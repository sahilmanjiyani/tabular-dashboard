    "noticeDate": 1558065600000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 28 &ndash; 30 Langley Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>28 &ndash; 30 LANGLEY AVENUE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue contains a pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached houses that, following the issuance of a building permit to the property owner and contractor William C. Jones in November 1892 that identified George Martel Miller as the architect, were under construction the following year (1893).&nbsp; Standing vacant for five years, the semi-detached house at 28 Langley Avenue was first occupied in 1898 by Reverend Enoch Barker, a Congregational minister.&nbsp; The following year, Louis J. Thomas and his family began a lengthy tenancy of 30 Langley Avenue that lasted until Thomas's death in 1913.&nbsp; Subsequently, his widow, Jennie Rife Thomas, purchased the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue with both houses.&nbsp; Archival records indicate that the Thomas Estate retained the property until the 1950s when it was converted to a legal rooming house.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is valued for the exceptionally highly-crafted design of the pair of semi-detached houses in the Queen Anne Revival style that was popular at the end of the 19th century and identified by the mixture of materials, intricate rooflines and variety of architectural detailing.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are particularly distinguished by the composition anchored by corner towers with turrets and original stained glass windows, and the sandstone cladding covering most of the principal (south) elevations.</p>\n<p>The William C. Jones Houses are historically associated with George Martel Miller (1854-1933), the Toronto architect who is credited with their design.&nbsp; In solo practice in Toronto for nearly half a century where the Gladstone Hotel (1894) on Queen Street West was amongst his early projects, Miller became known for his commissions for the famous Massey family, particularly the iconic Massey Music Hall (1894, in association with Cleveland architect, Sidney R. Badgley).&nbsp; Miller's extensive portfolio included residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming neighbourhoods where the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is a rare documented example of his work in Riverdale.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue has cultural heritage value for its role in maintaining, supporting and defining the historical character of the street and the adjoining area as it developed as a middle-class enclave in Riverdale with well-crafted detached and semi-detached houses from the late-19th and early-20th century.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are also historically, visually and physically linked to their setting on Langley Avenue on one of the original few lots not subdivided where they stand prominent in the street with the grandeur of their scale, roofline and distinctive architectural detailing.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the William C. Jones Houses at 28-30 Langley Avenue are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey plans, with the sandstone bases with the window openings (south)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the buildings, the hipped roof (south) with the flared eaves, the metal finial and the corner towers (southwest and southeast), the cross-gable roofs (east and west) with the enclosed gables and the wood detailing, the gambrel roof (north), the shed-roof dormers (east and west), and the brick chimneys</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick and sandstone cladding, and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevations, which are arranged as mirror images with the main entrances placed side-by-side in the first (ground) floor and accessed through round-arched portals with sandstone detailing (beneath the transoms, the doors have been replaced, as well as the steps leading to the entries)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevations, in the second storey, the flat-headed openings with transoms that are protected by an open porch with a classical column</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The corner towers (southeast and southwest) with the round-arched openings in the first (ground) floor, some of which contain stained glass windows, the flat-headed window openings in the upper stories, the conical roofs with the extended eaves with brackets, and the metal finials</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The sandstone detailing on the south elevations, with the lintels, continuous sills and band courses</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side elevations (east and west) with the brick detailing and the two-storey bay windows with the flat-headed openings, the brick flat arches and the stone sills</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 17, 2019, which is June 17, 2019.

    "noticeDate": 1557979200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 440 Unwin Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 440 Unwin Avenue, (Richard L. Hearn Generating Station), is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located in the Port Lands, on the north side of Unwin Avenue, between Cherry and Leslie streets, the property contains the Richard L. Hearn Generating Station, a massive brick-clad structure, 41-metres high, with an adjacent concrete chimney stack of 213 metres visible from multiple points in the city.&nbsp; The property also included an area for a switching station and transmission towers, a large coal pit, railway spurs, various outbuildings used for managing water intake and discharge and ancillary structures&nbsp;&nbsp; and a formally landscaped drive to the main, west-facing, entrance.&nbsp; The station was designed in 1949 by the Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation, opened in 1951 with plans for an extension which was completed in 1961. The concrete chimney stack was added to the property in 1971, replacing the previous eight chimney stacks.&nbsp; The station was decommissioned in 1983.&nbsp; The station interiors were initially transformed to accommodate film and television studio production and subsequently stabilized between 2014 and 2016 to host large public events such as Luminato.&nbsp;&nbsp; The building's context has evolved on its south side with a waterfront park which includes the Martin Goodman Trail and the adjacent Leslie Street Spit with its renowned abundance of animal and plant species, the Tommy Thomson Trail and the Outer Harbour Marina.</p>\n<p>The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2003. The Province of Ontario included it on the List of Provincial Heritage Properties in 2016 until November 2018 when the site was sold.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Hearn Generating Station has design value as a rare representative of a mid-20th century, steam power plant whose composition of diverse rectangular forms and single chimney stack is representative of the original processes which converted coal to steam and then electricity.&nbsp; The generating station exhibits a high degree of artistic merit in the principle, west, elevation of the Hearn which unites the three, large, rectilinear power-plant volumes with the lower administration block through a skillful application of the mid-century Style Moderne style.&nbsp; The artistic effect of the style is based in the simple geometric forms, the smooth, unrelieved, brick-clad surfaces which are offset by the dramatic linear patterns of the vertical banding of the modernist glass-block windows, framed with limestone piers, on the plant sections and the contrasting horizontal limestone banding around the windows of the administration block.&nbsp; Set at the top of a limestone staircase, the central principal entrance, with its combination of smooth limestone piers and the use of metal alloys in its curving canopy and paired entry doors, signals at once both the traditional gravitas of a civic institution combined with the modernity that is evident in the rest of the west elevation.&nbsp; In its structural capacity to provide the foundations and structure to both house, and support, the equipment of this vastly-scaled power generating station, along with its slip-form concrete chimney of 213 metres, the Hearn displays a high degree of technical achievement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hearn property is valued for its historic value and association as power station built at the end of World War II by Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEPCO), the provincial body now known as the Ontario Power Generation (OPG), to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for the City of Toronto for the booming post-war economy.&nbsp; With evolving supply and environmental concerns, the commission replaced coal burning with natural gas and installed the 213m chimney in 1971.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hearn is significant as it is associated with the development of the 1912 Harbour Commission plan for the Port Lands as a newly created waterfront which was intended to support shipping, industry, as well as, waterfront parks and recreation. Its location in the Port Lands enabled the supply of coal and water necessary for the generating station processes.</p>\n<p>The property also has value for its association with Richard L. Hearn, Chief Engineer and Chairman of (HEPCO).&nbsp; An award-winning engineer, for over 40 years, Hearn made a substantial contribution to the development of Ontario's power supply through the construction of numerous facilities, two of which broke records for size, in the completion of the first synthetic rubber plant, considered to a great Canadian construction achievement, as well as for the development of atomic energy uses for peacetime and nuclear energy.&nbsp; In 1967 he was appointed the Chancellor of Brock University and received the Order of Canada in 1973.</p>\n<p>The Hearn is valued as it reflects the work of the engineering firm of Stone &amp; Webster, established in Boston in 1889 and from the beginning specializing in the design, construction and management of power plants becoming leaders in the field to the point where it is estimated that 20% of all power generators in the United States originated with this firm.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Hearn is valued as it defines, supports and maintains the historic industrial character of the Port Lands.&nbsp; Initially designed as a coal-based generating station, relying on the supply of coal via rail links and water from the shipping channel, the Hearn was typical of the industrial uses intended for the Port Lands.&nbsp; Since its closure in 1983, it has been characteristic of the regeneration and adaptive reuse of the historic Port Lands structures as it has been leased by a film studio and more recently used as a temporary setting for the annual Luminato festival.</p>\n<p>Located on the north side of Unwin Avenue since 1949, the generating station has been historically, visually and functionally linked to the industrial and institutional uses as well as the parklands and recreational trails of the Port Lands and the Leslie Street Spit for over 70 years.&nbsp; With its impressive mass and 213-metre chimney, the Hearn is a landmark, a \"symbol of the Port Lands, seen from multiple vantage points.&nbsp; It terminates the southern views down Carlaw Avenue, as well as Logan Avenue and Bouchette Street.&nbsp; The view of the chimney has also been anticipated to terminate Broadview Avenue when it is extended.&nbsp; From the east and west the chimney is viewed from both ends of Unwin Avenue at Leslie and Cherry streets.&nbsp; At a city scale, it is a contributing feature of Toronto's waterfront skyline.</p>\n<p><strong>The heritage attributes of the Richard L. Hearn Generating Station are:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EXTERIOR</span></p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the north side of Unwin Avenue between Cherry and Leslie streets in the Port Lands</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the generating station which is composed of four parallel rectangular volumes of different heights (with a maximum height of 41 metres) enclosing the generating station functions, with a fourth three-storey administration block on the west elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which is primarily brick, with a concrete base, vertical limestone piers and bands surrounding the windows and glass block glazing, limestone coping bands at the roof line and piers at the principal entrance, with glass block and aluminum-alloy double-hung sash window frames</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the principal, west elevation, with the three horizontal bands of double-hung sash windows on the three-storey administration block, and the composition of the vertical panels of glass block, three on the central boiler hall, and two on the turbine hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal entrance on the west elevation with it projecting aluminum-alloy clad canopy and pair of doors, framed by two limestone piers with curving plans and the staircase with its limestone block balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The south elevation with its vertical and horizontal panels of glass block at the upper levels of the boiler hall and the fan room and the lower horizontal bands of windows, some with metal hoods, on the fan room and the pattern of bands of windows with upper square openings on the 1961 extension and the hooded metal duct vents at the upper level of the boiler room</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north elevation with its various extensions and accretions including the single story bay with brick buttresses, additional brick bays with stone copings, the two triangular bay windows, the metal hoods on horizontal window openings, the projecting periscope-type cylindrical ducts and the entryway originally used to accommodate the railway spur</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east elevation with its narrow horizontal bands of windows and unrelieved walls including the single-storey extension and the metal clad tower and its connection to the main building</p>\n<p>INTERIOR</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spatial volumes of the boiler hall, turbine hall and fan hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steel structure of the boiler hall, including the long east-west multi-storey passage through the steel structure</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concrete structures and steel beams of the turbine hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal entry lobby with its limestone cladding and stair with a metal balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control room configurations built-in desks with control panels as well as wall-mounted control panels&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ANCILLARY BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 213-metre slip-form concrete chimney stack</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various outbuildings and structures including the entry gate house and the four outbuildings adjacent to the shipping channel</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal tower and shed on the east end of the Hearn&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SETTING</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally the area surrounding the Hearn which contains elements relating to its use as a power generating station</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west side of the Hearn, the driveway leading from Unwin Avenue with the remaining circular drive at the entrance encompassing a circular planted area and the hedges planted along the west elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area for the switching station and transmission towers on the north side of the Hearn extending from the building face to the edge of the shipping basin</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The railway tracks which remain on the site</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 15, 2019, which is June 17, 2019.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 482 and 488 Wellington Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>482 WELLINGTON STREET WEST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 482 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1907 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A. Harvey.&nbsp; The property, along with the adjoining site at 488 Wellington Street West (which contains a complementary warehouse built in 1918), was retained by M. Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.</p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 482 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation, the sombre red brick cladding, the symmetrical placement of the openings, and the modest classical detailing with the banded brick pilasters and the brick corbelling beneath the south roofline.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the property at 482 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.</p>\n<p>The Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West is valued for its association with Toronto architect J. A. (James Arthur) Harvey, who was particularly noted for his solo practice that began in the late-19th century and focused on residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming residential neighbourhoods, as well as the first generation of walk-up apartment blocks in the city.&nbsp; The property at 482 Wellington Street West contains one of Harvey's rare documented commissions for an industrial building.</p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West.&nbsp; It was among the earliest warehouses constructed on the north side of the street.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 482 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the Granatstein Building (1918) at 488 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 482 Wellington Street West are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork on the south end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays by the pilasters with brick banding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, above the first (ground) floor (which has been altered), the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings with the brick and stone detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, with the flat-headed window openings that are viewed from Wellington Street West</p>\n<p>The glazed rooftop addition, dating to the 1990s, and the ground-floor link to the adjoining building at 488 Wellington Street West are not identified as heritage attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>488 WELLINGTON STREET WEST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 488 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1918 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A.

Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.</p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 488 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation with the extended centre bay, the sombre red brick cladding, and the symmetrical placement of the openings.&nbsp; It is particularly distinguished by the artificial stone applied for the base (south), the classically-detailed south entrance, the extended lintels and sills on the flat-headed window openings on the south elevation (that extend to the southerly bays on the east and west side walls), and the cornice with the dome-shaped finials at the south end of the flat roofline.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building (1918) was noted at the time of its construction for its innovative (at that time) concrete structure that was exposed on the side walls with the grid-like placement of the fenestration.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the property at 488 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp; Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp; Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.</p>\n<p>The Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West is also valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Hynes, Feldman and Watson, which had a short but notable practice beginning in 1915 that was headed by architect J. P. (James Patrick Hynes) and interrupted by the untimely death in 1919 of Isadore Feldman and the subsequent departure to New York City of Albert Edward Watson.&nbsp; While working together, the architects designed three venues for the Allen Theatre chain (including the extant building now known as the Danforth Music Hall), additions to St. Michael's Hospital and a small number of industrial edifices, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West that, with the earlier (1907) warehouse at 482 Wellington, formed a small-scale manufacturing complex in the block.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 488 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the original Granatstein Building (1907) at 482 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 488 Wellington Street West are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the window openings (south) and the artificial stone facing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick and artificial stone detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the artificial stone cornice and dentils at the south end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays, with an extended centre bay, by the pilasters that are surmounted by artificial stone dome-shaped finials</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, the placement of the main entrance in the left (west) bay of the first (ground) floor in a classically-detailed surround, and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed window openings with the continuous artificial stone lintels and sills</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, where the grid-work pattern of flat-headed window openings in artificial stone surrounds is continued in the southerly bays</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 10, 2019, which is June 10. 2019.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990 Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1555387200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 280 Jarvis Street and 288-290 Jarvis Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>280 Jarvis Street:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 280 Jarvis Street, containing a semi-detached house-form building, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located north of Gerrard Street East on the west side of Jarvis Street in the Garden District, the property at 280 Jarvis Street (originally known as 280-282 Jarvis Street) contains a pair of two-and-a-half storey, semi-detached houses, designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque Style and built as one of three pairs, extending from 280-290 Jarvis Street, by William Carlyle in 1890.&nbsp; In 1955 the semis at 280-282 Jarvis Street were converted to a lodging house and in 1972 were united as a single unit for office use at which time the property became known as 280 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; The design of the principal elevation of this pair of semis is mirrored by the other pair constructed at 288-290 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; In 1966, the pair at 284-286 Jarvis Street was demolished and their design as the centrepiece of the composition of the three buildings remains unknown. In 1973, City Council adopted a recommendation to include the property on the City's first Heritage Inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>William Carlyle's pair of semi-detached houses at 280 Jarvis Street is an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque.&nbsp; The style is evident in the picturesque massing of the principal, east elevation with its canted south-east corner rising as a turret, the broad archway framing recessed entries, the bay window at the second storey and the roofscape, with its octagonal, pyramid roof, dormers and two chimneys.&nbsp; The materials, sandstone, brick and terracotta, which is used in the shingles with scalloped or diamond-shaped tiles, decoratively-molded string courses and roof-top finials, are all quintessential Richardsonian Romanesque features. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the way the elevations of the pair is treated as a united whole so that each semi has different features rather than the predictable symmetry with identical doors and windows.&nbsp; Further, 280 and 288-290 Jarvis Street were constructed as mirror images of one another so that their prominent towers would anchor the outer corners of the whole assembly of the three pairs of semi-detached houses, creating a handsome group on Jarvis Street.</p>\n<p>The houses have historical value for their association with their builder, William Carlyle (1820-1903) a Scottish immigrant and successful contractor who was elected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward (1879-1890), served as Chairman of the Board of Works for the City of Toronto and was appointed Justice of the Peace for Toronto in 1884.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties have associative value as they contribute to an understanding of the historical development of Jarvis Street, representing the period of the street when it evolved as an attractive, late 19th-century avenue of broad, tree-lined boulevards faced with civic and religious institutions, grand estate homes and a range of more modest housing types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Carlyle houses are important for maintaining and supporting the late 19th-century character of Jarvis Street as well as contributing to the diversity of periods which the street presents as a record of its evolution.&nbsp; Located in the Garden District on the west side of the street on the block between Gerrard and Carlton streets, the two pairs of semi-detached houses maintain the setback and landscaped setting typical of 19th-century residential properties on Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Across the street, on the east side, are 19th-century buildings and a public space including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church (1875), the former Samuel Platt House (1849-50), Allan Gardens (1860) and St. Andrews Church (1878).&nbsp; To the north of the Carlyle houses, at 300 Jarvis Street, is the 1930 Art Deco Frontenac Arms hotel (now the Ramada Inn).&nbsp; To the south, at the intersection of Jarvis and Gerrard, is the Spanish-Revival Crown Hotel (now the Econo Lodge) at 335 Jarvis Street, and the Mid-century Modern, Juvenile and Family Courts Building at 311 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; These buildings and public spaces are just a small selection of the significantly rich collection of Toronto architecture and public amenities representing diverse periods, typologies and styles that characterise Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Constructed in 1890, the two pairs of semi-detached houses are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, contributing to the architectural diversity of this historically important Toronto thoroughfare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Carlyle houses at 280 Jarvis Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the west side of Jarvis, north of Gerrard Street East in the Garden District</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the house with the landscaped area in front of the house including the mature trees</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The cladding material which includes rusticated sandstone of two types, red brick and terracotta shingles in scalloped and diamond shapes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows openings including the ground floor openings of various rectangular sizes, the second floor bay window with its wood mouldings and panels, the&nbsp; pair of windows in the turret, single window on the canted corner and pair of smaller windows on the centre of the elevation, on the attic storey, the single window with three lights in the large dormer, the single opening in the small dormer and the pair of windows and single window in the turret</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The semis at 288-290 Jarvis Street were converted to lodging houses and then in 1969 they were converted for office use.&nbsp; The design of the principal elevation at this pair of semis is mirrored by the other pair constructed at 280 Jarvis Street (originally known as 280-282 Jarvis Street).&nbsp; In 1966, the pair at 284-286 Jarvis Street was demolished and their design as the centrepiece of the composition of the three buildings remains unknown.&nbsp; In 1973, City Council adopted a recommendation to include the properties on the City's first Heritage Inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>William Carlyle's pair of semi-detached houses at 288-290 Jarvis Street is an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque.&nbsp; This style is evident in the picturesque massing of the principal, east elevation with its canted north-east corner rising as a turret, the broad archway framing recessed entries, the bay window at the second storey and the roofscape, with its octagonal pyramid roof and dormers.&nbsp; The materials, sandstone, brick and terracotta, which is used in the shingles with scalloped or diamond-shaped tiles, decoratively-molded string courses and roof-top finials, are all quintessential Richardsonian Romanesque features. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the way the elevations of the pair is treated as a united whole so that each semi has different features rather than the predictable symmetry with identical doors and windows.&nbsp; Further, 280 and 288-290 Jarvis Street were constructed as mirror images of one another so that their prominent towers would anchor the outer corners of the whole assembly of the three pairs of semi-detached houses, creating a handsome group on Jarvis Street.</p>\n<p>The houses have historical value for their association with their builder, William Carlyle (1820-1903) a Scottish immigrant and successful contractor who was elected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward (1879-1890), served as Chairman of the Board of Works for the City of Toronto and was appointed Justice of the Peace for Toronto in 1884.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties have associative value as they contribute to an understanding of the historical development of Jarvis Street, representing the period of the street when it evolved as an attractive late 19th-century avenue of broad, tree-lined boulevards faced with civic and religious institutions, grand estate homes and a range of modest housing types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Carlyle houses are important for maintaining and supporting the late 19th-century character of Jarvis Street as well as contributing to the diversity of periods which the street presents as a record of its evolution.&nbsp; Located in the Garden District on the west side of the street on the block between Gerrard and Carlton streets, the two pairs of semi-detached houses maintain the setback and landscaped setting typical of 19th-century residential properties.&nbsp; Across the street, on the east side, are 19th-century buildings and a public space including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church (1875), the former Samuel Platt House (1849-50), Allan Gardens (1860) and St. Andrews Church (1878).&nbsp; To the north of the Carlyle houses, at 300 Jarvis Street, is the 1930 Art Deco Frontenac Arms hotel (now the Ramada Inn).&nbsp; To the south, at the intersection of Jarvis and Gerrard, is the Spanish-Revival Crown Hotel (now the Econo Lodge) at 335 Jarvis Street, and the Mid-century Modern, Juvenile and Family Courts Building at 311 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; These buildings and public spaces are just a small selection of the significantly rich collection of Toronto architecture and public amenities representing diverse periods, typologies and styles that characterise Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Constructed in 1890, the two pairs of semi-detached houses are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, contributing to the architectural diversity of this historically important Toronto thoroughfare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Carlyle houses at 288-290 Jarvis Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the west side of Jarvis, north of Gerrard Street East in the Garden District</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the house with the landscaped space in front of the house</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its rectangular plan with a canted, north-east corner rising as a turret, the east-facing sloped roof with an octagonal pyramid roof and two dormers, recessed entrance under a broad arch with its canted walls and rear, two-storey flat-roofed wing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which includes rusticated sandstone of two types, red brick and terracotta shingles in scalloped and diamond shapes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows openings including the ground floor openings of various rectangular sizes, the second floor bay window with its wood mouldings and panels, the pair of windows in the turret, single window on the canted corner and pair of smaller windows on the centre of the elevation, on the attic storey, the single window with three lights in the large dormer, the single opening in the small dormer and the pair of windows and single window in the turret</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window glazing which may include stained glass under the wood panels at the first floor and in the turret, the double hung sash window with multiple lights in the upper sash</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary entrance with its broad arch of sandstone, canted walls with small windows and pair of doors</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative terracotta elements including the sandstone belt courses and window sills, terracotta reliefs on the arch, wrapping the turret between the first and second storeys and the single terracotta finial</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative brick elements including the bands of alternating projecting brick headers between the top of the second storey and the eaves and third storey and in the recessed panels under the central pair of windows at the second storey</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood rafters at the eaves</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 16, 2019, which is May 16, 2019.

Hamilton Townsend when the latter firm completed high-end residential projects in Rosedale.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Alfred Baker House is through its contribution to the residential development of Mimico in the early 20th century.&nbsp; While Mimico originated as a late-18th century milling and farming community accessed by road and water, the area remained isolated until the arrival of the steam railway and the layout of a model town in the mid-1800s.&nbsp; The introduction of a radial railway at the end of the 19th century improved connections with Toronto and promoted Mimico's steady development after 1900 as a police village, village and town.&nbsp; During this era, former farmland was developed for both waterfront estates and residential subdivisions, the latter providing housing for workers in both Mimico and neighbouring New Toronto, as well as commuters to the city, including architect Alfred Baker.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 58 Wheatfield Road has cultural heritage value through its support for the character of the neighbourhood northeast of Lake Shore Avenue West and Royal York Road where the collection of residential, ecclesiastical and educational buildings forms the historic core of the Mimico.&nbsp; The Alfred Baker House is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Wheatfield Road where, with its vintage and appearance, it represents the initial development of the street after the turn of the 20th century.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Alfred Baker House at 58 Wheatfield Road are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of the street, south of Hillside Avenue.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey L-shaped plan, with the main body extending north and south and the short wing facing east toward Wheatfield Road.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-gable roof with the extended eaves and the purlins on the wing facing the street.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the stucco cladding and the wood and stone detailing.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation where, on the wing, the main entrance is placed in a moulded surround, protected by a wood canopy with pilasters and brackets, and flanked on the right (north) by a segmental-arched window opening.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation of the main body, the single-storey four-part square bay window in the first (ground) floor.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining fenestration, with the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings on the east, north and south elevations of the main body and wing.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation, the multi-paned windows in the openings in the second storey of the wing.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention Rosemary MacKenzie, Administrator, Etobicoke York Community Council, Etobicoke Civic Centre, Main floor, 399 The West Mall, Toronto, Ontario, M9C 2Y2, by 4.30 p.m. on or before May 8, 2019.</p>",

The property was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in July 1976.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value as a fine representative example of Queen Anne Revival styling applied to a large house form building in the first decade of the twentieth century. The style, identified by the variety of materials and decorative detailing, asymmetrical profile and complicated roof lines, represented the exuberant architecture of the late Victorian era. The George Gooderham Mitchell House is noteworthy for its attractive combination of forms, massing and stonework.</p>\n<p>The George Gooderham Mitchell House is valued for its associations with a member of Toronto's prominent Gooderham family, which co-founded the famed Gooderham and Worts Distillery (now the Distillery District).&nbsp; The property was developed and initially occupied by stockbroker George Gooderham Mitchell, grandson of George Gooderham.</p>\n<p>The property at 226 St. George Street is also valued for its association with the architect David Roberts, Jr., who had extensive connections to the Gooderham family.&nbsp; Roberts oversaw much of the work at the Gooderham and Worts Distillery (including the reconstruction of several buildings after the 1870 fire) and designed the landmark Gooderham Building at Wellington and Front Streets (completed in 1892 and known locally as the \"Flat-Iron Building\").&nbsp; He also prepared plans for the residences of various Gooderham family members, with the grand George Gooderham House (dating to 1889-91 and currently the York Club) at the northeast corner of St. George and Bloor Streets being among his best known commissions.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value for its visual and historical links to its setting in The Annex neighbourhood.&nbsp; Its appearance reflects the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century development of the area as one of the most sought-after residential enclaves in Toronto where the city's leading citizens occupied large-scale houses.&nbsp; The George Gooderham Mitchell House is significant in context with the three additional large Edwardian homes directly to the north, and other surviving house form buildings along St. George Street that were originally owned by members of the Gooderham family and/or designed by prominent Toronto architects and recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the George Gooderham Mitchell House at 226 St. George Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the west side of St. George Street south of Bernard Avenue</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2.5-storey plan above a raised basement</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The combination of hipped and gabled roofs including the oversized gable on the principal (east) elevation with its two symmetrically-arranged openings with double-hung sash windows, the gabled dormer windows and the brick chimneys, all on the north and south slopes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The deep profile of the eaves at the roofline on the principal (east) and north elevations and corner tower with the wood soffits, moulded fascia and decorative brackets&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation, which is organized into three bays plus 2.5-storey corner tower at the south end, a 2-storey bay window in the north bay and the centrally-positioned main entrance</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;The main entry located on the principal (east) elevation, which is elevated and protected by a flat-roofed porch with banded stone detailing on the columns and surmounted by a brick parapet</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;At the southeast corner, the 2.5-storey octagonal corner tower with its conical roof topped with a decorative metal finial</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the south side, the single-storey, rectangular, projecting bay with its arched parapet roofline and rectangular end walls</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the east, north and south sides, the fenestration with the stone detailing that incorporates broad flat-headed openings, double-hung sash windows, and a single fixed pane window in the central opening of the first-floor bay window at the north end of the principal (east) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north and south sides, the round-arched openings and their round-arched stone headers in the gabled dormers</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;The decorative glass transom above each window opening at the first-floor level on the principal (east) elevation including on the corner tower</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp;</strong> Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 2, 2019, which is May 2, 2019.

The first building constructed on the site in 1925-6 by the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. was the Main Building (including Buildings A+B), located at the northwest corner of the property and built to the design of Wells &amp; Gray Ltd., Engineers and Contractors.&nbsp; Building A included upper level offices and a shipping warehouse below and Building B contained the factory.&nbsp; From 1929 until 1980 the complex would undergo a continuous series of expansions, alterations and demolitions, primarily to the designs of Wells &amp; Gray, in response to an evolving sequence of functions related to the production of metal alloys, until operations ceased.&nbsp; One of these structures was the building known as Building G (1943) connecting the Main Building and Foundry Building (D, 1929). The proximity to the CNR railway to the south of the property meant that railway spurs were included in the property's evolution.&nbsp; In 1930 Hoyt amalgamated with other metal companies and became known as The Canada Metal Co. Ltd which continued to own the property until 2004.&nbsp; After that time the large industrial spaces accommodated Cinespace Film Studios until General Motors of Canada purchased the property in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Canada Metal Company Ltd. property, including the original Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. Main Building, the office and warehouse building (Building A), located at the property at 721 Eastern Avenue, is a fine representative of the industrial building type which emerged in the 19th century and whose key characteristic was a plan based on a structural grid of columns providing maximum internal flexibility for the accommodation of factory machinery and the production and movement of products.&nbsp; The structural grid is reflected on the building's principal (north) and side (west) elevations with their regular composition of brick piers flanking banks of windows.&nbsp; The embellishment of the building's elevations, the sculptural relief of the brick wall surface between piers and stepped brick bands over the second-floor windows, the classical styling of the entrance with its brick piers, precast stone bases and entablature incised with the word \"OFFICE,\" and the decorative panels above the entrance marked by precast stone squares, are typical of the early 20th century industrial buildings which frequently retained elements of the Classical style.</p>\n<p>Building G, the connecting link between the Main Building (A + B) and the Foundry Building (D), is valued for its design which, in the light-weight appearance of its structural steel framing and the clerestory roof, constructed to maximize daylight for factory workers, is expressive of a functionally elegant 20th-century industrial building typology.</p>\n<p>The property is valued for its association with the international Hoyt Metal Company, an important manufacturer and innovator of metal alloys in the early 20th century, which was based in the United Kingdom with branches in Australia, the U.S. A. and Canada. The Toronto branch was established in 1909 and managed by George F. Allen, an American inventor and patent-holder for inventions related to metal alloys.&nbsp; The property is also associated with the Canada Metal Company Ltd.&nbsp; In 1929, the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada merged with the Toronto-based Canada Metal Company Ltd. a nation-wide employer and manufacturer of metal alloy products, which started in the 1890s by William G.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 363-365, 367, 381 and 385-389 Yonge Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">363-365 Yonge Street</span> - Richard S. Williams Block</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 363-365 Yonge Street (Richard S. Williams Block) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould and Gerrard Streets, the Richard S. Williams Block (1890) is a four-storey commercial building. The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1974.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Richard S. Williams Block has design value as a fine representative and rare example in Toronto of a late-nineteenth century Victorian commercial building eclectically designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style with Moorish Revival details. The composition and detailing of the principal (west) elevation on Yonge Street, with its rusticated stone and red brick cladding combined with horseshoe arches, key and diaper patterns and decorative terracotta, display a high degree of artistic merit. In recognition of its architectural significance, the building was amongst some of the earliest included on the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in March 1974.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Richard S. Williams Block has historic value for its association with the architects, A. R. Denison and G. W. King. Concurrent with construction of the Richard S. Williams Block, the design partnership of Denison &amp; King produced two other known similarly eclectic Victorian buildings in the city that, together, represent a rare collection blending eastern design influences with contemporary western revival architectural styles. These include the Comstock Building at Victoria and Lombard Streets and the Athenaeum Club on Church Street, both of which are designated properties under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East, the Richard S. Williams Block has contextual value as it supports and maintains the late-nineteenth century commercial building character that defines much of the historic built form of downtown Yonge Street as it developed as Toronto's 'main street'.&nbsp; As one of a number of heritage properties on both sides of this block of Yonge Street, the Richard S. Williams Block is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Richard S. Williams Block are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey commercial building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its red brick, stone and terracotta cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressed metal cornice with its dentilled detailing at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of openings and detailing on the principal (west) elevation, divided vertically into three identical bays</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pattern and decorative detailing of the wood window mullions in the fixed glass panes on the principal (west) elevation at the second floor</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red brick details including the decorative frieze in a (diamond) diaper pattern below the roofline, the raised horizontal string courses in the spandrels above the horseshoe arches at the fourth floor, the brick voussoirs of the horseshoe-arched openings and the three identical key pattern designs repeated in the spandrel areas between the third and fourth-floor openings</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone details including the rusticated sandstone cladding of the four piers at the first floor level surmounted by their elaborately carved capitals, the four smooth capitals and rusticated lintel below the third floor, the smooth headers above the third-floor openings, the smooth sills and the imposts of the horseshoe arched openings at the fourth floor</p>\n<p>The terracotta details including the dentilled cornice with four decorative lion heads below the third floor, the three decorative tile borders framing the third and fourth-floor window openings and their respective cornices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">367 Yonge Street</span> - <strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street contains a three-storey building with retail at the ground floor and residential above. The building was constructed by 1869 of solid brick construction with brick cladding (currently covered with stucco on the west elevation).&nbsp; The property is located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street has design value as a representative example of a mid-nineteenth century commercial and residential building that blends elements of the Georgian and Greek Revival styles. The principal (west) elevation's symmetrically-arranged, flat-headed openings with their segmental-arched headers surmounted by scroll corbels and stone sills below are further enlivened by a corbelled brick Greek key pattern frieze below the decorative wood-bracketed roofline.</p>\n<p>The building has historic value as it is associated with the earliest development of this portion of Yonge Street in the mid-nineteenth century. Along with the two attached buildings directly north of the subject property, this three-storey group represents the tallest and earliest solid brick construction on this block of Yonge Street that otherwise contained only one or two-storey wood frame buildings before 1870.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street, between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East and directly adjacent to the Richard S. Williams Block at 363-365 Yonge Street, the property at 367 Yonge Street has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise commercial and residential building character that defined the historic built form of the area in the second half of the nineteenth century. It is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the property at 367 Yonge Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and residential building built on a rectangular plan with a pitched roof and brick chimney with its corbelled brick crown at the north end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its buff brick, stone and wood cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood fascia and soffit at the roofline and decorative corbelled brick frieze directly below</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symmetrical arrangement of flat-headed openings on the second and third floors of the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone detailing including the window sills and segmental-arched headers above the second and third floor openings with their scroll-shaped corbel brackets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the pattern of divisions of windows with a transom light in the first floor window, and for the second and third floor windows, as shown in the original architect's drawings, the double-hung sash featuring two lights over one</p>\n<p>Note: the stucco currently covering the brick cladding on the principal (west) elevation is not considered a heritage attribute</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">381 Yonge Street</span> - Yonge Street Mission Building</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street (Yonge Street Mission Building) is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street contains the Yonge Street Mission, an institutional building located on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East. Originally constructed in 1904, the Yonge Street Mission is a two-storey structure with a pitched roof including five skylights along the ridgeline. The principal (west) elevation was completely rebuilt to the designs of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, architects, in 1953.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Yonge Street Mission Building has design value as a fine representative of a low-rise, mid-twentieth century institutional building whose Stripped Classicism is indicative of the work of the prominent Toronto architectural firm, Mathers &amp; Haldenby. The style defines a transitional moment in Toronto architecture immediately following WWII that was expressed as a blending of Neo-Classicism and Modernism. At the Yonge Street Mission Building, traditional limestone cladding and details maintain a classical monumentality on the principal (west) elevation while the strong verticality of the openings and their minimalist detailing harken toward Modernist curtain wall construction and its associated aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street has historic value for its association with the history of the Yonge Street Mission founded in 1896 and the organization's operation at the subject location since 1904 (then owned by the Hon. Samuel Hume Blake), providing charitable services and social programs to vulnerable residents in Toronto. Since 1979, the Mission's Evergreen Centre has focused these efforts on the needs of street youth.</p>\n<p>The current building is valued for its association with the architectural firm of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, who designed many prominent mid-century structures across the city including the iconic Imperial Oil Building at 111 St. Clair Avenue West, which is recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East and abutting the corner property at 385-391 Yonge Street, the Yonge Street Mission has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century.</p>\n<p>The Yonge Street Mission is also valued as a long-time local landmark institution on Yonge Street, south of Gerrard. This charitable organization has provided assistance to Toronto's most vulnerable residents since its founding in 1896 and has operated continuously from 381 Yonge Street since 1904. The Yonge Street Mission is an important institution in the social history of the city that has been physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings for the past 115 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Yonge Street Mission Building are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey building with its flat roof behind a gabled parapet on the principal (west) elevation and pitched roof with five skylights over the auditorium (which are part of the Yonge Street Mission building's earlier 1904 design by the architectural firm, G. M. Miller &amp; Co. and appear in the original architectural drawings).</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its Indiana limestone cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood soffit at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration on the upper floor of the principal (west) elevation with the three evenly-spaced rectangular openings with stone headers, surrounds and profiled mullions in a three-over-three-over-three pattern centrally and two-over-two-over-two near the north and south ends</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carvings in their centred position in the limestone entablature on the principal (west) elevation including the lighthouse emblem, architectural lettering reading \"Yonge Street Mission\" and two equal-sided crosses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">385-391 Yonge Street (including 3 Gerrard Street East)</span> - Gerrard Building</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East, the Gerrard Building (1924) is a three-storey commercial and office building.&nbsp; The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1990.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building has design value as a fine representative, and rare example along Yonge Street, of the Modern Gothic style adapted to a commercial building. It is distinguished by its contemporary updating of a historical style with its sleek sandstone cladding and tripartite division of window openings in a variation of the Chicago Style along with stylized octagonal piers and wall buttresses.</p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building has historic value for its association with the prolific architects, Sproatt &amp; Rolph, and is recognized amongst the numerous fine commercial buildings the firm designed in Toronto during the early-twentieth century including the Royal York Hotel on Front Street. The site is also associated with The Forum, a grand High Victorian commercial block that formerly anchored this corner and contributes to an understanding of the evolution of the intersection at Yonge and Gerrard Streets.</p>\n<p>Situated prominently on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East the Gerrard Building has contextual value as it anchors and maintains the low-rise commercial building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. With its position on a corner lot and grand presence, the Gerrard Building stands as a reminder of the grandeur of Yonge Street as it developed in the early twentieth century.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Gerrard Building are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and office building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, the sandstone cladding with stone trim</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) elevation, the location and stone detailing of the entry at the south end of the building</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the flat-headed openings and their detailing on the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, which are divided vertically into four bays and six bays, respectively</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration in the upper floors on the west and north elevations including its tripartite division by secondary piers, and with the central opening containing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above each window pane on the second and third floors of the west and north elevations, the transom lights (currently opaque spandrels) with their four-over-four arrangement (as seen in the original architectural drawings and 1950 archival photographs)</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west and north elevations, the stone detailing including the octagonal piers with their faux compound piers and pointed finials at the first floor, and the decorative carved stone band surmounted by a continuous stone cornice directly above the third floor openings.3.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 2, 2019, which is May 2, 2019.

    "noticeDate": 1553054400000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 49 Spadina Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Steele Briggs Building:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is located on the northeast corner of Front Street West south of Clarence Square in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains a five-storey factory building that was constructed in 1911 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Seed Company commissioned the building, which it occupied it for over half a century.</p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in June 1973.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 49 Spadina Avenue as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design of the Steele Briggs Building is particularly distinguished by the application of different yet complementary classical detailing on the south, west and north elevations that face Front Street West, Spadina Avenue and Clarence Square, respectively, including the repetition of the round arch motif.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 49 Spadina Avenue is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building replaced earlier house form buildings that outlined the south edge of Clarence Square and anchored the south end of the collection of industrial buildings extending north along Spadina Avenue from Front Street West.</p>\n<p>The Steele Briggs Building is also valued for its historical association with the Toronto architects Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; Headed by Henry Sproatt and Ernest Rolph, the partnership became amongst the leading architectural firms in Canada and is credited with introducing the influential Neo-Gothic as a national style with the commission for Hart House at the University of Toronto.&nbsp; Often working in association with other celebrated Canadian architects, Sproatt and Rolph produced many of Toronto&rsquo;s most notable buildings, including the Royal York Hotel (1929) and Canada Life's 1931 headquarters on University Avenue.&nbsp; Sproatt and Rolph designed several factories and warehouses in King-Spadina, with the Steele Briggs Building remaining the most visually prominent with its setting overlooking Clarence Square.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 49 Spadina Avenue is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at Front Street West and Spadina Avenue where it anchors this major intersection, overlooks the adjoining Clarence Square and forms the south edge of the industrial buildings that line Spadina Avenue and include the Gale Building (1904) at 24 Spadina and the Systems Building (1907) at 46 Spadina, which are recognized heritage properties on the opposite side of the street.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Steele Briggs Building at 49 Spadina Avenue are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northeast corner of Front Street West and Spadina Avenue, south of Clarence Square</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey building above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The flat roofline with the brick parapets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The south, west and north elevations where the brick piers with the stone detailing organize the flat-headed door and window openings with the stone lintels and sills and the round-arched door openings with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones, including those originally designed for cargo doors</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; On the south elevation facing Front Street West, the round-arched door and window openings in each storey of the central bay</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The west elevation on Spadina Avenue where four-storey frontispieces surmounted by cornices contain round-arched arcades of windows</p>\n<p>There are no openings on the rear (east) elevation.&nbsp; The low-rise east wing, which has been altered, is not identified as a heritage attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation</strong> may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 20, 2019, which is April 19, 2019. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>",

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 15 Duncan Street and 158 Pearl Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>15 DUNCAN STREET&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street is worthy of&nbsp; designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act or its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street is located on the northeast corner of Pearl Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Company commissioned the building, which it occupied for over half a century.</p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 15 Duncan Street as a contributing heritage property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design is distinguished by its symmetry and the classical embellishments that are identified with the style, and particularly by the arcades of round arches on the principal (west) and the south elevations on Duncan and Pearl streets, respectively.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 15 Duncan is also through its half-century association with the Canada Printing Ink Company, which was internationally recognized for its development of inks for newspapers, magazines and other print media.&nbsp; In its manufacturing complex in King-Spadina, the company produced specialty inks and developed new technologies, which included the Maxichrom System (the forerunner to the Mix-and-Match System of the 1970s) where any colour could be matched using 12 basic inks.</p>\n<p>The Canada Printing Ink Building is valued for its contributions to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building was one of the first buildings completed on the former Upper Canada College lands following the redevelopment of the campus for industrial uses.</p>\n<p>The historical value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is also through its connection with the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg, which designed the Canada Printing Ink Building prior to the dissolution of the partnership.&nbsp; While W. R. (William Rufus) Gregg and his younger brother, A. R. (Alfred Holden) Gregg led successful architectural practices alone and with other architects, during the period from 1893 to 1904 when they worked together the pair is credited with several factories in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, including the Eclipse Whitewear Building (1903) at King Street West and John Street, the White Swan Mills Building at 158 Pearl Street, and the subject building.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is part of an important collection of former factories and warehouses that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto's manufacturing centre after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building is historically and visually linked to its setting where, with the adjoining White Swan Mills Building (1903) at 158 Pearl Street and the Southam Press Building (1908) at 19 Duncan Street, it is part of the surviving trio of early 20th century industrial buildings that anchor the northeast corner of Duncan and Pearl streets, south of Adelaide Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Canada Printing Ink Building at 15 Duncan Street are:</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northeast corner of Duncan and Pearl streets</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building above the raised base with the window openings</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roofline, with the extended eaves</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the principal (west) elevation on Duncan Street into 10 bays and the south elevation along Pearl Street into seven bays</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classical arrangement of the principal (west) and south elevations, with the base, the two-storey arcades and, above the stone cornice, the attic</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration, with the segmental-arched openings in the base, first and third stories (as well as the pair of diminutive openings above the west entrance), the round-arched openings in the second storey, and the brick and stone trim</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The west entrance, which is placed in the fifth bay from the south end and has been altered</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the two northernmost bays that have been altered to reflect the design of the original building.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>158 PEARL STREET</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street (which includes the address at 154 Pearl Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street is located on the north side of the street, east of Duncan Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The original occupant, White Swan Mills, producers of flour, cereals and spices, remained in this location for 25 years, followed by the stationery department of the Canadian Bank of Commerce (forerunner to today's Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC) for over 30 years.</p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 158 Pearl Street as a contributing heritage property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era. &nbsp;The design of the White Swan Mills Building is distinguished by its symmetry and the classical embellishments that are identified with the style, and particularly by the semi-arched pediments that mark either end of the principal (south) elevation.</p>\n<p>The White Swan Mills Building is also valued for its contributions to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The White Swan Mills Building was one of the first buildings completed on the former Upper Canada College lands following the redevelopment of the campus for industrial uses.</p>\n<p>The historical value of the property at 158 Pearl Street is also through its connection with the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg, which designed the White Swan Mills Building prior to the dissolution of the partnership.&nbsp;

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 64 Wellesley Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east), the property at 64 Wellesley Street East contains the Wellesley Apartments, a five-storey apartment building completed in 1931 according to the designs of Toronto architect J. E. H. Paisley.&nbsp; The site was identified as having cultural heritage interest in the North Downtown Yonge Street Urban Design Guidelines adopted by City Council in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance:</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is valued for its design as a well-crafted apartment building from the interwar era with features of the Georgian Revival style popularized for residential architecture.&nbsp; Its design is distinguished by the classical detailing on the main (south) entrance surround, which is a hallmark of the style, as well as the stair-hall window above with its scrollwork and metal balustrade, and the parapet along the south roofline with the stone-framed openings and triangular-shaped pediment.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Wellesley Apartments is through the connection of the building to Toronto architect J. E. H. (James Edward Harris) Paisley who designed the complex.&nbsp; Paisley was affiliated with the Toronto Board of Education and local practitioner Ferdinand H. Marani before he established a solo office in the 1920s.&nbsp; While his career was hindered by the Great Depression of the 1930s, he received recognition through his designs for a small collection of apartment houses for Grover C. Murdoch, including 64 Wellesley Street East, as part of his surviving portfolio in Toronto.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 64 Wellesley Street East has cultural heritage value through its historical, visual and physical links to its setting beside the Paul Kane House (1853, with later additions), a local landmark in Toronto, and its proximity to Church Street in the centre of the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Wellesley Apartments at 64 Wellesley Street East are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east) and beside (east of) the Paul Kane House</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey I-shaped plan, which is organized with the main body (south) and the wing (north)</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the parapet at the south end, which has stone-framed openings, stone coping and a triangular-shaped stone pediment in the centre</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (south) elevation, the organization of the wall into five bays with the central entrance in the first (ground) floor</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main (south) entrance, which is placed in a stone surround with classical detailing that includes an entablature, mouldings and brackets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, above the main entrance, the stair-hall window in the scalloped stone surround with the metal balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the south elevation, with the flat-headed single window openings in the centre and outer bays, the tripartite window openings in the remaining bays, and the stone sills, brick flat arches and stone keystones</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone band courses on the base and above the first- and fifth-floor openings on the south elevation, which extend across the south ends of the east and west side walls of the main body</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west elevations of the main body of the building, which continue the pattern and detailing of the flat-headed openings from the south elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north wing of the building, which is set back from the main body on the east and west sides and extended at the north end to complete the &ldquo;I&rdquo; shape</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north wing, the brick band courses and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed door and window openings with the brick and stone detailing.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of&nbsp; March 18, 2019, which is April 17, 2019.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 663 King Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Canada Biscuit Company Building</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 663 King Street West contains a four-storey industrial building that was constructed in 1900 for the Canada Biscuit Company according to the designs of Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; Following the demise of the latter company in 1905, the complex was acquired by a trio of manufacturers&rsquo; agents who headed the Anglo-Canadian Leather Company, which became the lead tenant in the building.&nbsp; A significant occupant between 1907 and 1921 was the Reliance Knitting Company, which eventually purchased the property following its amalgamation with another manufacturer.&nbsp; The Samuel Trees Company, a saddlery manufacturer that evolved its business to produce automobile fittings, owned and occupied the building for nearly 40 years, a period when the Bank of Montreal operated a branch on the premises.</p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West was listed on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Inventory) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 663 King Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of an early-20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheer scale of the building is viewed on Bathurst Street where the west elevation extends 14 bays to Stewart Street, and the principal (north) elevation on King Street is distinguished by the stone facing of the lower wall and the organization of the windows above in a three-storey arcade.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 663 King Street West is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building anchors a major intersection in King-Spadina where it is an integral part of the collection of industrial buildings that extends along King Street West.</p>\n<p>The Canada Biscuit Company Building is also valued for its historical association with Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; A member of one of the city&rsquo;s founding families, Denison accepted innumerable commissions during a career that lasted more than 40 years and included brief partnerships with other practitioners.&nbsp; During the period in the early 1900s when he designed the Canada Biscuit Company Building, Denison specialized in factories and warehouses, including the E. W. Gillett Company&rsquo;s complex (1912) on Fraser Street in today&rsquo;s Liberty Village, which is also recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 663 King Street West is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at King Street West and Bathurst Street where it anchors a major intersection in both King-Spadina and Toronto with the landmark Wheat Sheaf Tavern (1849) on the opposite (southwest) corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Canada Biscuit Company Building at 663 King Street West are:</p>\n<p>&middot;The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork along the north, west and south elevations</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation on King Street West with the stone cladding in the first storey where the main entrance is centered between two oversized flat-headed window openings and, in the upper three stories, brick arcades organize the pairs of flat-headed window openings with the continuous stone lintels and sills</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extended west elevation on Bathurst Street, with the organization and detailing of the flat-headed door and window openings, some of which have been altered</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the west elevation, the cornice between the third and fourth stories in the southerly seven bays, which marks the point where the complementary extra storey was added</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation on Stewart Street extending five bays, which has an entrance in the first (ground) floor and pairs of flat-headed window openings above, and where the cornice between the third and fourth stories is continued from the west elevation</p>\n<p>No heritage attributes are identified on the east elevation.&nbsp; The adjoining four-storey building at 60 Stewart Street is not identified in the Statement of Significance (Reasons for Designation).</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 13, 2019, which is April 12, 2019.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 901 Lawrence Avenue West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West (Columbus Centre) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the two categories of historical/associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West is located on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West, to the west of Dufferin Street and contains the Columbus Centre, which includes the three-storey St. Mary's Training School (1941), a one to three storey sports and recreational centre including a swimming pool (1962, 1968 and 1980), a double-storey entry atrium (1980) with the Joseph Carrier Art Gallery and the three-storey Rotunda (1980) through an agreement between the Italian Canadian Benevolent Corporation (ICBC) and the Government of Ontario. The complex is clad primarily in red brick with curtain wall-glazing on the 1978-80 addition and faces a large landscaped setting with a sculpture garden and tennis courts.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West has historic value for its association with the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, a religious order whose purpose was to provide refuge and education for young women who found themselves in perilous conditions or living as social outcasts.&nbsp; The Sisters purchased the property to build the St. Mary's Training School, which was occupied by the school from 1941 to 1973 and later adapted as part of the Columbus Centre complex.&nbsp; The property is also valued for its association with the ICBC (now known as Villa Charities) which through the dedicated, voluntary leadership of individual members undertook the fund-raising campaigns and building of retirement and community facilities for Italian Canadians from the late 1960s onward which culminated in 1980 with the completion of the Columbus Centre which has become a primary centre for Italian Canadian culture and heritage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Located on the south side of Lawrence Avenue West at the heart of the former Sisters of the Good Shepherd property, the Columbus Centre has contextual value as it defines and maintains the character of the property as a hub of Italian community facilities.&nbsp; The rotunda which is the most visible architectural expression of the Columbus Centre sits within a sculpture garden with mature trees, pathways and tennis courts, surrounded on its borders by social and cultural institutions of the Italian community which include schools, retirement homes, long-term care, as well as the social, athletic, business, research and cultural facilities of the centre itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Columbus Centre is visually, physically, functionally and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp; As the physical and cultural focal point of the landscape as well as the neighbouring community, the rotunda is a landmark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the property at 901 Lawrence Avenue West are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The setback, placement and orientation of the Columbus Centre rotunda sitting within the landscaped setting of the sculpture garden which includes mature trees, and provision for sculptures and a pathway which connects with the Villa Colombo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The scale, circular form and massing of the three storey rotunda designed as a large gathering space</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The mosaic-tiled and brick door frame at the east corner of the south elevation of the St. Mary's Training School with the words \"St. Mary's Training School\" and decorative mosaic patterns</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Francine Adamo, Administrator, North York Community Council, North York Civic Centre, Main Floor, 5100 Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario M2N 5V7, within thirty days of February 14, 2019, which is March 18, 2019. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2019 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.331 billion, which is fully funded from the 2019 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services. The recommended new bulk water fee reflects the cost of providing that service.</p>\n<p>The Budget Committee has established two subcommittees to hear public deputations on the 2019 Capital and Operating Budgets.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario, 35 Kingsway Crescent",
    "noticeDate": 1544677200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 35 Kingsway Crescent under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 35 Kingsway Crescent, containing the building originally known as the Richard and Elsie Pearce house, in the Kingsway, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 35 Kingsway Crescent is located on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, and sits in a line of grand estate houses sharing a cohesive architectural character, scale and setting on the ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley in the Kingsway Park (now known as the Kingsway) neighbourhood established by Home Smith &amp; Co. The property contains the house originally known as the Richard and Elsie Pearce house designed and constructed in 1929 by the architects (R. S. Hanks) and builders of Home Smith &amp; Co. The two-and-a-half storey building was designed on an elongated cruciform plan with a steeply pitched hipped roof intersected by a lower gabled roof, punctuated by two tall chimneys. In 1946, Matthew James and Dorothy Boylen purchased the property and, in 1947, added the garage to the north in the same style as the house. In 1960, a semi-circular sunroom was added to the south end of the house. Two iron gates with stone gate posts provide access to the semi-circular drive which frames a deep lawn. Mature trees and shrubs contribute to the picturesque setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Pearce house at 35 Kingsway Crescent has design value as an exceptionally fine example of a Kingsway Park \"Old English Manor\" house type designed in concordance with the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement with Tudor Revival style elements. The characteristics of this type are evident in the grand scale combined with a contrasting informal picturesque character which is achieved through the massing with its steeply pitched roofs combining hipped and gable forms, the tall sculptural chimney, the projecting entrance bay with its gable roof jetty over a bay window and the recessed door of the principle entrance. The house displays a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit in the variety of form which is complimented by an equivalent mix of materials including Humber Valley River stone which is rough-hewn, the half timbering with stucco cladding of the second storey and the small paned casement wood windows. The informality of the Arts and Crafts principles is extended through the arrangement of the casement windows in a random pattern with a variety of sizes from one to three sections. The entry bay is given particular emphasis with a greater variety of materials, rough and smooth stone, half timbering with cross patterns as well as red-brick \"nogging,\" and leaded-glass windows with panes of stained glass. The location of the house on the Humber River Valley ridge, with its landscaped grounds, mature trees and broad lawn surrounded by a circular drive, adds to the characteristic picturesque quality of the property. Artistic merit is also evident in the care with which the two-car garage located to the north was designed with corresponding materials and Tudor Revival details to match the original house.</p>\n<p>The Pearce house has historical value as it is associated with the early history and development of Kingsway Park, one of the suburban neighbourhood estates, including Baby Point, which were created through Robert Home Smith's Humber Valley Surveys. The 1914 surveys laid out as a sequence of neighbourhoods intended to preserve the natural landscape, contours and character of the area surrounding the Humber Valley River ravine, from the Queensway to Dundas Street West. Development of the individual lots was regulated by Home Smith &amp; Co., Robert's company of architects, builders and craftsmen, who would bring to life his vision of an arts and crafts community inspired by English garden suburb models and architecture with the motto \"a little bit of England away from England.\" Smith's development was also grounded in the local context of the Humber River and the historic King's Mill, the first to be established on the Humber following the settlement of the Town of York in 1793. The Pearce house was designed and built by Robert S. Hanks, a leading architect at Home Smith &amp; Co.</p>\n<p>The Pearce house is also valued for its historical association with the owners of the property, Richard Pearce (1892-1967) and Matthew James Boylen (1907-1970) who with his wife Dorothy owned the property from 1947 until his death. Both men had significant ties to mining in Canada and are inductees in the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame. Richard Pearce was the Editor and President of the Northern Miner which was founded in 1915 and run by Pearce and his brother Norman from 1916 through to the 1960s. The paper continues to be the primary source of news on Canada's mining industry and is globally regarded as the authority on Canadian mining. Matthew James Boylen began prospecting in 1922, from the 1930s owned numerous mines in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and then in the 1950s discovered and developed deposits of volcanogenic sulphide near Bathurst, New Brunswick which, according to the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, was historically and economically significant as well as being scientifically important for providing new models for mineral exploration that have been adapted internationally.</p>\n<p>Constructed in 1929 by Home Smith &amp; Co. in accordance with their design principles for the Humber Valley Survey suburbs and the Kingsway Park neighbourhood in particular, the house is physically, visually and historically linked to its surroundings. Situated on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, the Pearce house has contextual value as it maintains the early 20th century Arts and Crafts Garden Suburb character of Kingsway Park.</p>\n<p>Located on the ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley to the east, the house is one in a series aligned on the ridge that share a similar grand manor house scale and Tudor Revival style elements. These houses on the east side are part of the larger collection of houses found throughout Kingsway Park that were designed in either an English cottage-manor house type or symmetrical Georgian style, constructed in a variety of sizes and typically featuring steeply pitched roofs, river stone, stucco, half-timbering or brick cladding with additional elements of craftsmanship evident in decorative details, stained and leaded glass, finely crafted wood door and window frames. The natural setting of the Kingsway, which is enhanced by the picturesque meandering street layout that follows the contours of the original terrain of the Humber River Valley, supported by the mature trees and landscaping of individual residential properties, is characteristic of the neighbourhood context.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Pearce house are:</p>\n<p>1. The placement and orientation of the building on its property on the east side of Kingsway Crescent, north of Bloor Street West on a ridge overlooking the Humber River Valley</p>\n<p>2. The setting of the house with the front lawn and semi-circular driveway</p>\n<p>3. The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its cruciform plan, primary hipped roof and secondary cross-gable roof, prominent asymmetrical chimney mass which incorporates two windows capped by a shingled roof and projects beyond the front elevation</p>\n<p>4. The cladding material which includes rough-hewn river stone at the first floor and on the chimneys, ashlar-finished stone around the primary entryway, red brick on the chimneys and in the \"nogging\" of the entry bay, half timbering on the main entry bay, stucco and half timbering with a pattern of diagonal bracing on the second floor level and the decorative diagonal patterning in the jettied central gable which is supported on decoratively carved wood brackets as well as the roof cladding which is cedar shingles on both the house and garage</p>\n<p>5. The windows, which are arranged in an informal pattern in a range of sizes with corresponding bay widths and feature wood casements or leaded glass casements with stained glass elements</p>\n<p>6. The primary entrance elements which include the ashlar-finished stone door frame with its stepped key-stones above the arched opening with its decorative mouldings, the wood door with its glazed openings and leaded glass</p>\n<p>7. The garage with its steeply pitched gable roof, stone base and half timbering in the gable with a decorative square pattern featuring diamonds and the decorative bargeboard and gable pendant post, and pair of casement windows and pair of garage doors</p>\n<p>8. The stepped and curved stone wall that connects the house to the garage</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention Rosemary MacKenzie, Administrator, Etobicoke York Community Council, Etobicoke Civic Centre, Main Floor, 399 The West Mall, Toronto, Ontario, M9C 2Y2, by 4:30 p.m. on or before January 14, 2019.</p>",

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act,  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1537243200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 771 Yonge Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 771 Yonge Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the southeast corner of Asquith Avenue, the property at 771 Yonge Street contains a three-storey commercial building that, according to archival records, was constructed in 1872 for property owner Elizabeth French and operated as a hotel by her husband, Joseph French. Following his death, a series of hostelries occupied the property, including the Langston House and the CPR Hotel. Among the occupants in the 20th century was Boris Volkoff&rsquo;s first dance studio in Toronto. The property at 771 Yonge Street was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Property (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1984.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 771 Yonge Street has cultural heritage value for its design as an important surviving example in Yorkville of a late 1800s commercial building with the symmetry and gable roof retained from the Georgian style linked to first-generation commercial edifices in Toronto. Its late-19th century vintage is apparent in the scale and elaborate corbelled brickwork along the Yonge Street elevation.</p>\n<p>French&rsquo;s Hotel is valued for its historical association with the Village of Yorkville (1853-1883), which was an independent municipality prior to its annexation by the City of Toronto. The subject building was part of the commercial district along Yonge Street that served the brickyards, breweries and related industries that formed the basis of the community. As a hotel in operation for more than 40 years, French&rsquo;s Hotel was one of a selection of hostelries located near the key intersection of Yonge and Bloor streets where a tollgate once adjoined the boundary between Toronto and Yorkville.</p>\n<p>The property at 771 Yonge Street is also valued as the location of the first dance studio in Toronto opened by the famed Russian-born dancer, choreographer, director and teacher, Boris Volkoff (1900-1974), who was revered as the &ldquo;father of Canadian ballet.&rdquo; With premises at 771 Yonge from 1930 to 1945 and while training innumerable dancers, Volkoff founded the Volkoff Canadian Ballet as the forerunner to a professional ballet company in Canada, and worked on co-productions with the Toronto Opera Company (forerunner of today&rsquo;s Canadian Opera Company).</p>\n<p>Contextually, French&rsquo;s Hotel contributes to the character of Yonge Street, north of Bloor Street, where it reflects the evolution of the area in the late 19th century as it evolved from an incorporated village to a city neighbourhood along the important corridor known as Toronto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street.&rdquo; French&rsquo;s Hotel is also historically, visually and physically linked to its surrounding on Yonge Street where it anchors the southeast corner of Asquith Avenue and, with the contiguous row of late-19th century commercial buildings on the west side of the street between Cumberland Street and Yorkville Avenue, marks the east entry into the commercial centre of the former Village of Yorkville.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the commercial building at 771 Yonge Street are:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Asquith Avenue</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; The gable roof with the parapets with brackets (north and south) and, along the west end, the corbelled brickwork with the dentils and the band courses (the brick end chimneys have been removed)</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick and stone detailing (the red brickwork has been painted)</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation where, above the first-floor storefront (which has been altered) the symmetrically-arranged segmental-arched window openings with the stone sills and the brick flat arches</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp; The north side elevation on Asquith Avenue, with the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings in the upper stories with the brick and stone detailing (on the north and south elevations, the window openings in the attic level have been bricked in)<br />Note: the south side elevation adjoins the neighbouring building. The rear (east) wall and the two-storey east wings are not identified as heritage attributes.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of September 18, 2018, which is October 18, 2018.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 10-20 Widmer Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong>:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>The properties at 10-20 Widmer Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Located on the west side of the street, north of King Street West, the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street contain six 2&frac12;-storey house form buildings dating to 1876 whose construction is attributed to Toronto builder William A. Grant and his brothers.&nbsp; As the surviving six units of the original 10-part row, the Widmer Street Row Houses occupy land that was first developed for Toronto&rsquo;s inaugural general hospital and leased by the institution&rsquo;s trustees until the sale of the properties in the late 20th century.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong>:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>The properties at 10-20 Widmer Street have cultural heritage value for their design as the oldest surviving group of row houses in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that are designed in the prototypical Toronto Bay-n-Gable style.&nbsp; The remaining six units of the original group of 10 buildings are distinguished by the elevated entrances, the bay windows that extend two stories from the raised bases to the first (ground) floor, and the original detailing that includes the brick corbels organizing the units into pairs, the pair of paneled wood doors on 10 Widmer, and the fish-scale shingles and wood detailing in the gable on 20 Widmer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The associative value of the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street is through their contribution to an understanding of the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they are located on the lands originally developed for Toronto&rsquo;s first general hospital when the community was an institutional enclave (where the third Provincial Parliament Buildings were also situated) adjoined by residential subdivisions.&nbsp; The Widmer Street Row Houses were constructed following the relocation of York (Toronto) General Hospital, but prior to the transformation of King-Spadina as the city&rsquo;s new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; With the removal of most of the residential buildings that characterized the neighbourhood, the Widmer Street Row Houses survived to reflect the late-19th century appearance of this part of King-Spadina.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the properties at 10-20 Widmer Street contribute to the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it emerged in the 19th century as an institutional and residential enclave prior to its evolution as Toronto&rsquo;s industrial centre.&nbsp; The Widmer Street Row Houses are historically, visually and physically related to their surroundings where they stand as the last remaining 19th century residential buildings on Widmer Street.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong><br /><br /></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Widmer Street Row Houses at 10-20 Widmer Street are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The setback, placement and orientation of the row of six house form buildings on the west side of the street, north of King Street West</li>\n<li>The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey buildings with the rectangular-shaped plans above the raised bases (the door openings in the bases are not original)</li>\n<li>The gable roofs with the steeply-pitched gables on the east ends, with the surviving fish-scale shingles and wood detailing in the gable on 20 Widmer Street (the current bargeboard is not original), and the brick chimneys on the south elevation of 10 Widmer and the north elevation of 20 Widmer</li>\n<li>The yellow brick cladding with the brick, stone and wood detailing</li>\n<li>The arrangement of the six row houses into three pairs, which are organized as mirror images with the elevated entrances placed side by side, accessed by sets of stairs with wood detailing, and protected by open porches (the porches on the units at 18 and 20 Widmer Street have been removed)</li>\n<li>On the east elevations, the segmental-arched door openings containing transoms and, on the building at 10 Widmer Street, the pair of paneled wood doors</li>\n<li>The fenestration on the east elevation of each individual building, with the bay window that extends from the base to the first (ground) floor and contains large segmental-arched openings that are repeated in the second storey above the bay window and the entrance</li>\n<li>The detailing on the east elevations, with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones on the door and window openings, the stone sills, and the corbelled brickwork along the roofline separating each pair of buildings</li>\n<li>The rear (west) wings and additions are not identified as heritage attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2N2 within thirty days of September 11, 2018, which is October 11, 2018.

The building is a three-storey warehouse type, brick clad with regular rows of windows on the north and south elevations and new windows on the east elevation added during alterations in 1990.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:</strong></p>\n<p><br />The property at 495 King Street West, the rear wing of the Conboy Carriage Co., has design value as a representative example of a commercial warehouse building dating to the late 19th-early 20th century that is typical of the King Spadina neighbourhood. The long rectangular plan of the three-storey building with windows on the long sides, brick cladding and brick piers, expressive of the internal post and beam structure, are characteristic features of the building type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rear wing of the Conboy Carriage Co. has historical value as it contributes to an understanding of the development of the King Spadina neighbourhood as it was transformed from being primarily institutional and residential in the first three quarters of the 19th century to being one of the City&rsquo;s prime industrial centres following the Great Fire of 1904. Located on a property that once extended behind Daniel Conboy&rsquo;s residential property, the wing has direct associations with Daniel Conboy and indicates the steady expansion and success of his enterprise prior to its relocation to the east side of the Don River south of Queen Street in 1907.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rear wing has contextual value as it contributes to defining and maintaining the late 19th-early 20th century commercial/industrial scale and character of the King Spadina HCD. Its brick clad, narrow, three storey rectangular mass contributes to the typical scale, but its location at the rear of the block, set perpendicularly to the Conboy building is atypical adding variety to the configuration of the open space surrounding the typical blocks with their narrow end elevations facing the street with adjacent narrow alleys.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p><br />The heritage attributes of the property at 495 King Street West are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the warehouse building at the rear of the lot perpendicular to the Conboy Carriage Co. building at 485 King Street West<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey rectangular block<br />&bull; The brick cladding with the regularly spaced brick piers on all four elevations<br />&bull; The pairs of windows between the brick piers on the north and south elevation<br />&bull; The absence of openings on the west elevation<br />&bull; The brick detailing including the stepped bricks at the cornice and the segmental-arched openings and the stepped brick corbelling at the north-east corner of the building between the first and second floor levels<br />&bull; The stone window sills</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>519 King Street West</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation:</strong></p>\n<p><br />The property at 519 King Street West (part of the J.

C. Musson Block which was constructed by John C. Musson in 1885 as part of his development of Plan M26. The building is a three-storey commercial row originally containing six units with residential accommodation on the upper two floors and is distinguished by the craftsmanship evident in the detailing of the brick cladding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p><br />As part of the J. C. Musson block located at 519-529 King Street West, the property at 519 King Street West has design value as a fine representative of the rare Neo-Grec style expressed on a commercial block type of (originally) six units including residential accommodation. The three-storey, rectangular block exhibits a high degree of craftsmanship as well as artistic merit in the brick detailing which, in its expression of structure with the brick piers, segmental arches and stone imposts and without any reference to a historic architectural style, is a fine representation of the Neo-Grec style.</p>\n<p>The property at 519 King Street West, as part of the J.C Musson Block, has historical value for its potential to yield information about the King Spadina neighbourhood and particularly about the period of the district between 1880 and 1900 which had a greater predominance of residential properties. The Block represents a building typology associated with a commercial main street adjacent to a residential neighbourhood which was part of the original development of Plan M26 undertaken by John C. Musson in 1885 and remains an indication of one of the characteristic periods in the continual historic transformation of this neighbourhood since its establishment as the Garrison Common to New Town to industrial sector and finally to a revitalized arts and entertainment district which continues to evolve.

It adds to the variety of a district predominantly characterized by warehouses as a commercial main street building type, well established on Toronto&rsquo;s other historic main street arteries, and typically associated with a more residential neighbourhood and therefore representative of the 1880-1900 period of the HCD.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 295 Indian Road under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Paul Hahn House</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 295 Indian Road is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 295 Indian Road contains a 2&frac12;-storey detached house form building that is located on the east side of the street between Boustead and Radford avenues, south of Bloor Street West.&nbsp; Located on Indian Road, which was laid out by architect John George Howard to access his &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm, the dwelling at 295 Indian Road was constructed in 1906 for Toronto musician and businessman, Paul Hahn according to the designs of the notable Toronto architect, Eden Smith.&nbsp; It was part of an artistic enclave that developed on Indian Road by enthusiasts of the Arts and Crafts movement before Eden Smith and many of his neighbours relocated to Wychwood Park.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 295 Indian Road is valued for its design as a fine representative example of an early-20th century house form building designed in the Period Revival style influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement as interpreted by architect Eden Smith.&nbsp; As one of the architect&rsquo;s trademark &ldquo;turned-about&rdquo; houses that placed the main entrance on the wing, rather than the front of the building facing the street, its design is further distinguished by the complicated roofline with the tall chimney and, on the interior, the inglenook on the first (ground) floor.</p>\n<p>Historically, the property at 295 Indian Road is linked to the development of the street by the early Toronto architect, John George Howard, on his &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm east of his famed &ldquo;High Park&rdquo; estate.&nbsp; To access his property, Howard laid out Indian Road as a meandering route, purportedly inspired by an aboriginal trail, which represented a departure from the grid pattern of streets in Toronto and complemented the adjoining finely-crafted residential district introduced later in the late-19th and early-20th century.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Paul Hahn House is through its identification with the significant Toronto architect Eden Smith, who designed the dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; The English-born architect is noted for his distinctive designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts ideals of William Morris and his circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Toronto, following his high-profile commission for St. Thomas&rsquo;s Church (1892) on Huron Street, Smith focused on designing houses in high-end neighbourhoods and enclaves throughout the city, completing his own house and others (including the subject property) on Indian Road before relocating to Wychwood Park, which was amongst the first Heritage Conservation Districts in Toronto.</p>\n<p>The property at 295 Indian Road is also valued for its association with its original owner, Paul Hahn (1875-1962), who commissioned the house.&nbsp; A member of a famous artistic family, Hahn was a celebrated cellist, music teacher and ornithologist in Toronto who opened a self-named piano store on Yonge Street in 1913 that remains in operation over a century later.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Paul Hahn House is valued for its contribution to the character of the area, which was founded in the 1840s as Toronto architect John George Howard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunnyside&rdquo; farm, which he developed east of his &ldquo;High Park&rdquo; estate.&nbsp; Howard laid out Indian Road where, in the late-19th and early-20th century the adjoining lands were the setting for an upscale artists&rsquo; enclave with the custom-designed residences that architect Eden Smith designed for himself, Paul Hahn and other members of Toronto&rsquo;s artistic community.</p>\n<p>The property at 295 Indian Road is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting where it is adjoined by the Eden Smith House (1896) to the south and two dwellings on neighbouring Boustead Avenue dating to the early 1900s that were designed by Eden Smith for fellow supporters of the Arts and Crafts movement.&nbsp; The latter properties are recognized on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Paul Hahn House at 295 Indian Road are:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of the street between Boustead and Radford avenues<br />2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey house form building<br />3.&nbsp; The combined gabled, hipped and canted roofline with the hipped dormers (north and east), the flat-headed opening in the south gable and, on the north end, the tall brick chimney with the corbelled brickwork near the base<br />4.&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing<br />5.&nbsp; The L-shaped plan, where the main entrance is placed on the south side of the L in a flat-arched surround with the original panelled wood door with the glass insert (the glass has been replaced)<br />6.&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the north and south side elevations and the rear (east) elevation, the fenestration with the segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings that contain single or multiple windows and, on the rear (east) elevation, the surviving bay window with the hipped roof and wood detailing<br />7.&nbsp; The secondary entrance on the north side elevation with the wood detailing<br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enclosed verandah at the southeast corner (originally open, it is part of the evolution of the building)<br />9.&nbsp; On the interior, the inglenook with the brick fireplace and hearth<br />Note: The current enclosed porch protecting the main entrance is a complimentary addition. The rear (east) entrance is an alteration.&nbsp; Neither is identified as a heritage attribute.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2N2 within thirty days of September 5, 2018, which is October 5, 2018.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 37 Mutual Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>McBurney &amp; Saunders Row House</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p><br />The property at 37 Mutual Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p><br />Located on the east side of the street south of Shuter Street and adjacent to the mid-19th century heritage properties at 79, 81 and 85 Shuter Street in the Garden District neighbourhood, the property at 37 Mutual Street is part of a group of four two-and-a-half-storey Second Empire-style row houses that were completed in 1890 by developers Jackson A. McBurney and Joseph Saunders, and first occupied by members of the city&rsquo;s new middle class.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</p>\n<p><br />The property at 37 Mutual Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets the criteria for municipal designation prescribed by the Province of Ontario under the three categories of design, associative and contextual values.</p>\n<p>The property at 37 Mutual Street is valued for its design and construction as part of the intact row of four two-and-a-half storey house form buildings at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street, dating to 1890 and displaying a high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit. They are also valued as fine examples of the Second Empire Style, which was featured in some of the grand estates on the adjacent Jarvis Street, and emulated in the design of middle-class row houses on neighbouring streets like Mutual Street. The elements of the style are seen primarily in the Mansard roof and in the rich elaboration of well-preserved brickwork and wooden architectural elements evident at the windows and cornices. The row house type is represented in the two-and-a-half storey building on a raised basement. All four principal elevations have nearly identical arrangements, though every other facade is reversed, rather than simply repeating. This lends a symmetry to adjacent units, and to the overall composition. Other features of the group include the round-arched main entrance, set to one side, with the similarly round-arched window adjacent at the first floor level. Combined with the alternating pattern of each dwelling, this articulation creates a pleasing massing pattern that unifies the group. Within the Garden District, the group of four dwellings at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street comprise a very well-preserved example of this aspirational row house type that emerged in the last quarter of the 19th century as representative of the tastes and means of the city&rsquo;s new middle class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the group of four two-and-a-half storey row houses at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street, the property at 37 Mutual Street is also valued for its contribution to an understanding of the historical development of this part of the Garden District neighbourhood, which was transformed through John G. Howard&rsquo;s late 1840s design from a single family estate to a dense urban neighbourhood. Initially, the subject properties were a part of one of the series of hundred acre Park Lots, created with the founding of the town of York in 1793 and granted to the influential Jarvis family. Its subdivision included the creation of Jarvis Street, an extraordinarily wide, grand avenue where influential and wealthy Torontonians built their estates and which provided a connection from the Second Concession Line (Bloor Street) southward to the town&rsquo;s commercial and civic institutions and lakefront wharves. Mutual Street, in contrast, represents a residential enclave developed for the middle class, adjacent to the grand Jarvis Street estates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually the property at 37 Mutual Street is valued for its role as part of the group of four row houses at 37, 39, 41 and 43 Mutual Street in defining, maintaining and supporting the historical character of the Garden District. This character was defined in the last quarter of the 19th century with row houses and semi-detached houses of a consistent scale and built form which featured two-and-a-half storey dwellings, on raised basements, with sloping attic roofs expressed as gable, hips or mansards. Within the context of a neighbourhood in flux due to ongoing development pressure, the property at 37 Mutual Street is valued as part of the group of four row houses for its historic, physical and visual links with its surroundings for nearly 130 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><br />The heritage attributes of the property at 37 Mutual Street are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The location, set back and orientation of the building as the southern anchor of a group of four row houses on the east side of Mutual Street<br />2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the building with its two-and-a-half storey height and L-shaped plan on a raised basement with a mansard roof and brick corbelled firebreak wall<br />3.&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its round-arched windows and door openings, paired windows at the second floor and paired, hipped dormer windows in the mansard roof<br />4.&nbsp; The materials with the orangey-red brick with brick detailing, rough-hewn sandstone of the raised basements, slate shingles in a rectangular and rosette pattern, the decorative wood detailing of the dormer windows, console brackets below the roof eaves, and detailing of the mansard roof and soffits at both the second and third floor levels<br />5.&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the stained-glass transom in the round-arched window</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> the metal cladding covering the slate hipped roofs of the two roof dormers is not considered a heritage attribute</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2N2 within thirty days of August 29, 2018, which is September 28, 2018. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>",

At the east end of the site, the building identified by the entrance address of 495 Wellington Street West comprises a three-storey factory building with a two-storey rear (south) wing dating to 1909 that was extended to the south by a three-storey addition built in 1928. Directly west, the four-storey office and warehouse building was completed in 1912. All the buildings were designed by the Toronto architectural partnership of Wickson and Gregg. The property at 517 Wellington Street West was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1974 and designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1979 by By-law 758-79. In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017. In 2018, the HCD was under appeal The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 517 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 517 Wellington Street West has cultural heritage value for its design as a complex of early 20th century industrial buildings sharing complementary Edwardian Classical detailing from the most popular style of the pre-World War I era. Identified by its somber red brick work, symmetrical appearance and restrained classical detailing, Edwardian Classicism was particularly popular for industrial buildings, including the Copp Clark Company Complex. The style is evident on the factory building (1909) where the north elevation on Wellington Street West incorporates a frontispiece with a parapet and stone detailing that contains a classically-detailed entrance at its base. Directly west, the larger combined office building and warehouse (1912) is viewed from both Wellington and Portland streets and is particularly distinguished by the treatment of the corners with the oversized piers and the stepped parapets, the stone embellishments along the north and west rooflines, and the cornice that continues from the north to the west elevation.</p>\n<p>The Copp Clark Company Complex is valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Wickson and Gregg, which designed all of the buildings. Headed by A. Frank Wickson and Alfred Holden Gregg, the partners opened their practice in 1905 and received immediate acclaim for their design for the Carnegie-funded Central Reference Library at College and St. George streets (completed in 1909 in association with architect A. H. Chapman) and Timothy Eaton Memorial Church and Sunday School (1911-1913) on St. Clair Avenue West. Both had previous experience designing factories and warehouses in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which continued with the Turnbull Elevator Company Building (1906) on John Street, a trio of buildings adjoining the intersection of King and Duncan streets (1906-1907), and the Copp Clark Company&rsquo;s Wellington Street complex. The firm and its successors, Wickson, Gregg and Blackwell designed the subsequent additions to the latter site.<br />The property at 517 Wellington Street West is associated historically with the publishing industry in Toronto and Canada as the location beginning in 1909 of the Copp Clark Company Limited. The origins of the firm dated to the 1840s when Scottish-born bookseller and publisher, Hugh Scobie opened a stationery store in Toronto that evolved into a printing and bookbinding enterprise. Following Scobie&rsquo;s death, part of his business was acquired by partners Thomas Maclear and George Elliott Thomas, whose employees included William Walter Copp (1826-1894). In 1869, Copp and Henry James Clark continued the enterprise as Copp, Clark and Company while suspending the retail operation. The &ldquo;Canadian Almanac&rdquo; founded by Scobie remained a cornerstone of Copp Clark&rsquo;s varied publications, which expanded in the late 19th century to include maps, school textbooks and popular literature. During the interwar era, controlling interest in Copp Clark was acquired by the descendants of George Elliott Thomas, who retained the company until 1955 when it was renamed the Copp Clark Publishing Company. In the 21st century specializing in products and services relating to global financial markets, Copp Clark remains Canada&rsquo;s longest continuously operating book publisher.</p>\n<p>The Copp Clark Company Complex has associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which developed on part of the Military Reserve that was established in the 18th century west of the Town of York and was subsequently subdivided and sold in the early 19th century to accommodate the expansion of the City of Toronto. The plan of subdivision incorporated two important public squares (Victoria Memorial Square, with its military burial ground, and Clarence Square) that were connected by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place as the setting of upscale housing. Most of the original housing stock was removed as part of the transformation of the King-Spadina neighbourhood from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing centre after the Great Fire of 1904. The Copp Clark Company Complex was amongst the earliest industrial sites on Wellington Street West, west of Spadina Avenue, and contributed to the transformation of the formerly residential enclave.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 517 Wellington Street West supports the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s industrial centre. In King-Spadina, the Copp Clark Company Complex reflects the conversion in the early 20th century of the section of Wellington Street West originally known as Wellington Place from a residential enclave between Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square to part of Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector. As one of the earliest industrial developments on the street, the Copp Clark Company Complex is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on an expansive corner lot where it is viewed from Wellington, Portland and Front streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The heritage attributes of the Copp Clark Company Complex at 517 Wellington Street West are:</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the complex of buildings on the southeast corner of Portland Street, consisting of the 3-storey factory building (1909) with the two-storey south wing (1909) and the three-storey south addition (1928), and the adjoining four-storey office and warehouse building (1912)</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; 1909 Factory Building (entrance address at 495 Wellington Street West</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings on the north elevation<br />4.&nbsp; The flat roofline with the parapet with the stone diamond motifs<br />5.&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing<br />6.&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation, which is organized into five bays by brick piers with stone coping (at the west end, the glazed link connecting this building to the 1912 office building and warehouse is not original to the design)<br />7.&nbsp; On the north elevation, in the second bay from the east end, the frontispiece (under the parapet) with the main entrance placed at the base in a surround with classical detailing (the door has been replaced)<br />8.&nbsp; The fenestration on the north elevation, with the mixture of flat-headed and segmental-arched openings with the brick flat arches, the stone sills and, on some of the openings in the frontispiece, the stone keystones<br />9.&nbsp; The detailing on the north elevation, with the cornice with the brick corbels beneath the third-floor openings<br />10.&nbsp; The east elevation, which is viewed from Wellington Street West and is devoid of openings<br />11.&nbsp; The two-storey south wing (1909), with the raised base and the symmetrically-organized segmental-arched openings with the brick and stone detailing on the east and west elevations<br />12.&nbsp; The three-storey south addition (1928), which is L-shaped with brick cladding and symmetrically-placed fenestration (the fourth storey is an addition)</p>\n<p><strong>1912 Office and Warehouse Building</strong></p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey near-square plan above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings<br />2.&nbsp; The flat roof with the stepped parapets with the coping on the northeast, northwest and southwest corners, the penthouse at the southeast corner and the chimney on the south end<br />3.&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing<br />4.&nbsp; On the north elevation on Wellington Street West and the west elevation on Portland Street, the corner frontispieces and the brick piers with the decorative stonework that organize the segmental-arched window openings in the first (ground) and fourth floors and the flat-headed window openings in the second and third floors<br />5.&nbsp; The entrance on the north elevation, which is placed in a classical surround in the westernmost bay, and the cargo entrance on the west elevation<br />6.&nbsp; The south elevation, which is viewed from Portland Street and has flat-headed and segmental-arched openings<br />7.&nbsp; The detailing, with the brick and stone detailing on the window openings on the north, west and south elevations, and the cornice that extends above the first-floor openings across the north and west elevations</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the amendment of the designating by-law may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of August 29, 2018, which is September 28, 2018.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Notice of Intention to Designate</p>\n<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>Reasons for Designation</p>\n<p>The property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>Description</p>\n<p>The property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue contains a four-unit, two-storey brick and stone-clad apartment building, which is the most northern property in a unique set of ten properties of similar design, owned and developed by Henry H. Talbot, builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and designed by the architect W. Breden Galbraith on the east side of Bayview Avenue north of Parkhurst Boulevard and south of Eglinton Avenue East. Metrolinx declared it a Provincial Heritage Property on June 8, 2016.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</p>\n<p>Constructed in 1936-37, the four-unit apartment building with a single entrance at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue has design value as a representative example of a Tudor Revival variation on the Arts and Crafts, the style associated with the Garden Suburb aesthetic, featuring, paired bay windows with stone bases, a row of four double hung sash windows and a front door with a Tudor arch stone surround with a keystone and quoins. The design value of this property is amplified by its being one of the same four-unit apartment building typology with a variety of styles associated with the Arts and Crafts Style, constructed as a set on the east side of Bayview Avenue.</p>\n<p>The property is valued for its association with the Leaside Garden Suburb developed in 1912 by the Canadian National Railway and designed by the landscape architect Frederick Todd Gage. It contributes to an understanding of the development and growth of Leaside in the 1930s which integrated a variety of housing typologies addressing various income levels and household types. It demonstrates the variety of the work undertaken by Henry H. Talbot, a locally-based builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and it reflects the work and ideas of the well-known residential designer W. Breden Galbraith.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue is important in defining and maintaining the consistent character created with the other nine, adjacent, four-unit apartment buildings. Their 1930s period detail, reflecting the Arts and Crafts influence, contributes to and maintains the overall character of the Leaside Garden Suburb. The four-unit apartment buildings maintain not only the period and architectural quality of scale and style but they also contribute to a distinctive social quality in Leaside&rsquo;s planning and built form which provided a wide range of housing typologies.</p>\n<p>Heritage Attributes</p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the building at 1783-1785 Bayview Avenue are:</p>\n<p>&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the hipped roof, two-storey, four-unit apartment block built on a rectangular plan with two projecting bay windows with hipped roofs flanking a central entrance on the principal (west) elevation<br />&bull; The cladding of the principal (west) elevation with its variegated red brick, the stone cladding of the bays which extends up to the first floor windows<br />&bull; Material details include the stone belt courses which double as window sills, stone trim around the door, vertical brick headers over the first floor windows and wood trim beneath the broad, over-hanging eaves of the roof over the second floor windows<br />&bull; The windows on the principal (west) elevation with the bay windows at both levels featuring a row of four double-hung sash with four vertical lights over a single light, two windows in the sides of the bays and the central second storey double hung sash with six lights over one.<br />&bull; The single main entrance with its wide Tudor arch with stone quoins and a keystone framing a glazed door with a pointed head and sidelights<br />&bull; The cladding of variegated red brick on the side and rear elevations (north and south and east respectively) and the rusticated concrete block at the raised basement level</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Francine Adamo, Administrator, North York Community Council, North York Civic Centre, Main floor, 5100 Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario M2N 5V7, within thirty days of June 18, 2018, which is July 18, 2018.

    "noticeDate": 1529294400000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 58 Atlantic Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>Reasons for Designation</p>\n<p>The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (specifically the portion with the entrance address at 25 Liberty Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>Description</p>\n<p>The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue is located on the southwest corner of Atlantic and Liberty and contains a 3&frac12;-storey industrial building (known for convenience purposes as 25 Liberty Street) that was constructed in 1901 according to the plans of the Toronto architectural firm of G. M. Miller and Company. It formed part of the manufacturing complex developed in 1898 and afterward by the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company for the production of windmills, steel towers, pumps, motors, and other equipment, particularly for railway companies and farmers. The company remained a fixture in the neighbourhood now known as Liberty Village for 40 years.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</p>\n<p>The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) has design value as a well-crafted example of an industrial building that was designed after the turn of the 20th century when Edwardian Classicism was emerging as the most popular architectural style. Exhibiting the restrained brick detailing and classical features identified with the style, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building is particularly distinguished by the corbelled brickwork beneath the roofline, as well as the distinctive oriel windows that overlook Atlantic Avenue and Liberty Street.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building is also through its associations with the Toronto architectural practice of G. M. Miller and Company, which designed it. Headed by George Martel Miller who opened a solo practice in 1886, his firm was best known for the many projects it undertook for members of Toronto&rsquo;s famous Massey family, which produced agricultural implements for international distribution and funded philanthropic projects in the city. Miller was the supervising architect for the Massey (Music) Hall before completing alterations to the Massey-Harris Company&rsquo;s office building to the west on King Street West near Strachan Avenue. He designed the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company&rsquo;s complex over the period from 1898 to 1910, including the former factory (1901) at 25 Liberty Street.</p>\n<p>The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) is valued for its contributions to the historical development in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of the community adjoining the southeast corner of King Street West and Dufferin Street as an important industrial centre at the west end of Toronto. With the adjacency of two railway lines and the subdivision and servicing of the land, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company was one of the first manufacturers to build its factory in the area where it operated for 40 years.</p>\n<p>The contextual value of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building (1901) is through its role in defining, maintaining and supporting the character of the former manufacturing enclave in the area southeast of King Street West and Dufferin Street where it is part of an important surviving collection of industrial buildings, many of which are included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Register. The property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) is also valued contextually for its visual and historical links to its surroundings in the neighbourhood now known as Liberty Village where it anchors an important intersection on the main east-west route through the community. In this location, the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building faces the St. David&rsquo;s Wine Growers Company Building at 60 Atlantic Avenue, which it complements in vintage and scale, and overlooks to the northeast the landmark boiler house and smokestack of the former Brunswick-Balke-Collender complex at 40 Hanna Avenue, which are other recognized heritage properties in Liberty Village.</p>\n<p>Heritage Attributes:</p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Company Building on the property at 58 Atlantic Avenue (25 Liberty Street) are:</p>\n<p>&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Atlantic Avenue and Liberty Street<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the building, with the rectangular plan that rises three stories above a base with window openings<br />&bull; The red brick cladding with brick, stone and wood detailing<br />&bull; The flat roof with the brick chimney on the west end<br />&bull; The principal (north) elevation on Liberty Street, which is divided into three bays by brick pilasters<br />&bull; The main (north) entrance, which is set in the right (west) bay under a classical pediment with oversized brackets<br />&bull; The fenestration on the principal (north) elevation, with the segmental-arched window openings that are arranged in pairs in the three stories, the oversized segmental-arched window opening in the centre of the first (ground) floor, and the oriel window in the second storey<br />&bull; On the long east elevation on Atlantic Avenue, which extends 11 bays, the continuation of the fenestration from the north elevation, including the oriel window in the second storey<br />&bull; The rear (south) elevation, where the door and window openings are organized by brick pilasters<br />&bull; The detailing on all of the elevations, with the corbelled brickwork beneath the roofline, the brick flat arches and stone sills on the window openings, and the oversized wood brackets on the oriel windows (north and east) that overlook the intersection of Liberty and Atlantic</p>\n<p>The west elevation is almost completely concealed by the adjoining buildings at 35 Liberty Street.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of June 18, 2018, which is July 18, 2018.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1529294400000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Notice of Intention to Designate</p>\n<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 50 King Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>Reasons for Designation</p>\n<p>The property at 50 King Street East (including the entrance address at 2 Toronto Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>Description</p>\n<p>The property at 50 King Street East anchors the northwest corner of the intersection of King and Toronto streets and contains a 5-storey commercial building that was completed in 1887 for the Quebec Bank, the Montreal institution that opened a number of branches in Ontario. Toronto architect, D. B. Dick prepared the plans for the building, which was extended by a complementary west addition. Following a fire in the 1940s, the Quebec Bank was restored and the west addition reconstructed. The site was listed on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s inaugural Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973. It is located in the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood Heritage Conservation District, which was adopted by City Council in 2015.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</p>\n<p>The property at 50 King Street East has cultural heritage value for its design as a well-crafted late-19th century commercial building that displays the red brick construction above the extended stone base, the polychromatic detailing and the archetypical round-arched motif associated with the late-19th century Romanesque Revival style. The primary elevations (south and east) are distinguished by the tripartite organization, the arcades organizing the window openings between the base and the attic, and the decorative brick, stone and terra cotta detailing.</p>\n<p>The Quebec Bank is historically associated with the notable architect, D. B. Dick, who designed the building in 1886. Born and trained in Scotland, Dick worked with the distinguished Edinburgh firm of Peddie and Kinnear, which purportedly inspired his Romanesque Revival designs in Toronto where he relocated in 1873. After working with Scottish expatriate, Robert Grant, in 1876 Dick established a solo practice that resulted in ongoing commissions for the Consumers&rsquo; Gas Company, industrialist William Davies, and the University of Toronto, including the restoration of University College in the 1890s.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the property at 50 King Street East is also through its contribution to an understanding of the development and significance of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood as it evolved from its origins as &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo; and survived the Great Fire of 1849 as the commercial and institutional heart of Toronto. Within this community, the Quebec Bank was part of the area along King and Toronto streets that was the hub of banking, insurance companies and utilities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries prior to the shift of the financial district west of Yonge Street. While the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood underwent an economic downturn in the 20th century before it was revitalized in the 1960s, the Quebec Bank remained and reflects the late 19th century vibrancy and the continuing vitality of the city&rsquo;s oldest community and neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>The property at 50 King Street East is also associated with Sir Henry Mill Pellatt (1859-1939) who owned the property between 1911 and 1921. While best known for commissioning &ldquo;Casa Loma&rdquo; as his private residence in Toronto, Pellatt was noted for his involvement in banking, the Toronto Stock Exchange, insurance companies and resource development. He is remembered as the co-founder of the Electrical Development Company of Ontario, which introduced electricity to Toronto for street lighting and the street railway prior to the enterprise&rsquo;s acquisition by the forerunner to Ontario Hydro. With his role in business ventures across Canada and beyond, by the World War I era when he acquired the property at 50 King Street East, Pellatt was identified among the country&rsquo;s leading financiers.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 50 King Street East contributes to the character of the St. Lawrence Neighbourhood, which is distinguished as the birthplace of Toronto where Old Town was situated and King Street was extended westward as the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo; in the 19th century. With its setting on King Street East, the Quebec Bank contributes to an important surviving collection of 19th- and 20th-century commercial and institutional buildings, among them the neighbouring King Edward Hotel (1903), opposite, and St. James&rsquo; Cathedral (1851) to the east. Anchoring the northwest corner of King and Toronto streets, the Quebec Bank marks the entrance to Toronto Street with its important collection of 19th-century edifices, including the Seventh Post Office (1853), the National Historic Site at 10 Toronto Street, and the Consumers&rsquo; Gas Company offices (1876 ff.) at 17 and 19 Toronto Street, which are recognized heritage properties.</p>\n<p>Heritage Attributes</p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Quebec Bank on the property at 50 King Street East are:</p>\n<p>&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the northwest corner of King Street East and Toronto Street<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the 5-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan above the raised stone-clad base with the segmental-arched door and window openings<br />&bull; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork (the original cornice and parapet have been removed)<br />&bull; The brick and stone cladding with the brick, stone and terra cotta detailing<br />&bull; On the south elevation extending two bays and the east elevation extending eight bays, the arcades with the banded brick and stone piers that organize the flat-headed window openings in the second and third floors and the round-arched window openings in the fourth storey<br />&bull; The detailing, with the voussoirs on the first-floor openings, the spandrels with the terra cotta panels beneath the third-storey windows, and the spandrels with the corbelled brickwork beneath the fourth-storey openings, which have archivolts and mouldings<br />&bull; On the principal (south) elevation, the main entrance to the building (the entrance has been altered)<br />&bull; The rear (north) elevation, which is viewed from Toronto Street and has stone band courses<br />&bull; The west addition, which extends two bays on King Street East and complements the original (1887) building in its height, scale, materials (excluding terra cotta) and fenestration, and is slightly setback in relation to the older building</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of June 18, 2018, which is July 18, 2018.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1526616000000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1132 Broadview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1132 Broadview Avenue, known as the Salvation Army Broadview Village (SABV), which contains the coach house that was originally part of the Taylor-Davies families&rsquo; Chester Park estate, and the later administrative and three residential buildings which are part of the SABV, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1132 Broadview Avenue is located on the west side of Broadview Avenue, north of Pottery Road and contains a collection of buildings relating to three distinct periods and history of use on the remaining 2.5 acres of the original 40-acre Chester Park Estate property. The first period dating from 1881-1940 is associated with the residential use of the property by the Taylor and Davies families. The remaining building from this time is a one-and-a-half storey coach house with a truncated hipped roof on the main building and an adjacent flat-roofed, single-storey wing.</p>\n<p>The second period, 1940-1967, is associated with the adaptive re-use of the house and coach house by the Salvation Army as a children&rsquo;s home. In 1961, the coach house was renovated for residential use.</p>\n<p>In the third period, new buildings were added to the property including three, split-level two-storey &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; (1967) with low-pitched gable roofs. When the cottages were added in 1967 they were arranged to maintain the original driveway and the view from Broadview Avenue of the Coach house. At that time the proposed new administration building was designed to surround and maintain the original 1880s house. It was only in 1976, that the decision was made to demolish the house when funding for the administration building was received. The new two storey, split-level, administration building (1976) with a central, mono-pitch roof section with adjacent flat-roofs. a residential wing also with a mono-pitched roof, and a flat-roofed addition (2010) which provided a new entry and an elevator. The buildings are clad in mottled red, orange, grey and brown brick except for the addition which is clad in brown brick. From the mid-1990s to the present the property was used as a home for adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Recognition</strong></p>\n<p>The coach house was included on the Inventory of Historical Buildings in East York, by the East York Historical Society in 1993 and received a plaque from the East York Historical Society with assistance from the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Culture and the Salvation Army.</p>\n<p>In 2006 it was included on the City of Toronto&rsquo;s Heritage Inventory now known as the Heritage Register.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Salvation Army Broadview Village has design and physical value which is evident in the original Chester Park coach house and the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building. The coach house has design value as a representative example of a late 19th century coach house building with a truncated hipped roof, symmetrical dormers and fine craftsmanship evident in the brick relief details including the segmental arched openings with raised voussoirs and the quoins.</p>\n<p>The SABV administration building has design value as a representative example of a Post-War Modernist style institutional building which displays artistic merit in its combination of traditional and modernist elements which balance the dignity of an institution with a more progressive social agenda aimed at creating nurturing residential environments for children.</p>\n<p>The SABV has historical value as an evolving campus first functioning from the 1880s as the grand estate home of the Taylor and Davies families who were significant to the community as important contributors to the development of the Todmorden Mills and the Don Valley Brick Works as well as to the growth and prosperity of the former borough of East York and the City of Toronto. From 1940, the property has been associated with the social and community outreach work that has been fundamental to the historic origins of the Salvation Army, who purchased the property in 1940 to accommodate their girl&rsquo;s home known as &ldquo;The Nest,&rdquo; previously located at 450 Pape Avenue.</p>\n<p>From that time it has evolved to accommodate young boys, older youth and from the mid-1990s adults. The property is also significant for its association with Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman who are commemorated in the naming of the 1976 administration building and who had been generous benefactors of the Salvation Army. Known for his leadership from the 1920s in the Lions Club and his support for youth and community leadership, the Harry A. Newman Foundation continues to be a supporter of programs at various Toronto universities and colleges as well as individual institutions.</p>\n<p>The property has contextual value as an evolved estate property supporting both the late 19th and mid-twentieth century character of the Broadview North neighbourhood. Situated at the rear western edge of the property at 1132 Broadview Avenue and viewed from the street and the main entrance along the driveway, the coach house is important for maintaining the original 19th century character of the area which featured many large estates with homes constructed by the Taylor and Davies families as well as to their businesses in the valley below preserved at the Todmorden Mills and Don Valley Brickworks sites. It contributes to the residential character of the neighbourhood including the adjacent Hillside Drive. The coach house is physically and historically linked to its surroundings.</p>\n<p>Facing the west side of Broadview Avenue the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building is important in maintaining and supporting the character and scale of the area with its low height, residential character and its set back from the street. A part of the neighbourhood since 1976, it is historically and functionally linked to the evolution of Broadview North which following the subdivision of the Taylor and Davies&rsquo;s estates gradually incorporated smaller-scale residential properties as well as community institutions and social agencies.</p>\n<p>With the Chester Park coach house and the Margaret R. and Harry A. Newman Building, the property is a landmark in the Broadview North neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the coach house are:</p>\n<p>&bull; The placement and orientation of the building on the property on the west side of Broadview Avenue, north of Pottery Road, facing the end of the driveway which leads from Broadview Avenue to the coach house.<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the building which includes a principal one-and-a-half-storey main section with a truncated, hipped roof and eight dormers and to the south a one-storey flat-roofed wing<br />&bull; The orange-red brick cladding with its fine relief detailing of segmental arched openings with three raised voussoirs and the quoins at the corners on all elevations and the stone/composite stone sills on all window openings<br />&bull; On the principal, east elevation, the remaining remnants of four arched-headed openings &ndash; two modified to accommodate a new higher windows and a door with glazed surrounds, two bricked-in but with the voussoirs still intact, and two small arches still retaining their original configuration for a door and a narrow window<br />&bull; On the south, side elevation, the openings on the ground floor level which include the two windows on the wing with their a transom light over three vertical lights, and on the original carriage house the original high level window with the segmental arched head and the adjacent window opening which has been extended to accommodate a door<br />&bull; On the west, rear, elevation the openings on the ground floor level which include on the wing, four equally spaced segmentally arched openings, three with high level windows and one extended to accommodate a door and on the main coach house building five arched headed window openings of varying height and length<br />&bull; On the north, side, elevation, the four, high, segmentally arched openings (currently filled in) and the single glazed opening<br />&bull; The eight dormers, three on the east elevation, three on the west and one facing south and one facing north all symmetrically arranged within the truncated hipped roof.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and the City of Toronto, Province of Ontario  462 Eastern Avenue, Notice of Intention to Designate",
    "noticeDate": 1525147200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 462 Eastern Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>The property at 462 Eastern Avenue (Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd.) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>The property at 462 Eastern Avenue is a landmark building located on the north side of Eastern Avenue, on the entire block between Booth and Logan avenues, and contains the two-four storey, red brick-clad bakery complex completed between 1920 and 1929 with various later one to four storey additions at the rear.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:</p>\n<p>The Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd. complex has design value as a representative example of a well-designed and carefully crafted early twentieth century industrial building. The regular articulation of the exterior elevations with pilaster reflects the internal structural grid typical of factory spaces. The design with its two towers, pilasters shallow pediment(s), and stone details on the pilasters and window sills and at the base demonstrates the attention to aesthetic architectural considerations with which this primary baking facility for Brown&rsquo;s Bread was conceived from the 1920 version through to the additions of 1925, 1926 and 1929.</p>\n<p>The property at 462 Eastern Avenue has associative value with the historic origins of Brown&rsquo;s Bread which was established by the baker Louis Brown at the north-east corner of Eastern Avenue and Booth Avenue in 1892 and continued to operate and expand on that site until it merged with Inter City Bakery, and then General Bakeries which was finally acquired by George Weston Ltd. in 1985. Weston continued to operate at this site until 2014. For 120 years this facility represented significant production of baked goods and employment. The property is also valued for its association with the numerous prominent architectural and engineering firms who designed the facility including McGiffin &amp; Smith, architects, Harkness, Loudon &amp; Hertzog, engineers, Sydney Comber, architect and Canadian leader in the design of bakeries, and the Engineering Division of the Chicago-based W. E. Long Company, specialist in all facets of bakery operations from packaging and advertising through to facilities construction.</p>\n<p>Contextually, Brown&rsquo;s Bread Ltd. is valued as it maintains the early twentieth century industrial character of Eastern Avenue in south Riverside. Along with the Consumer Gas Buildings on the south side of Eastern Avenue, Brown&rsquo;s Bread is an important architectural landmark in the area representing local industry and employment. It is historically and functionally linked to its surroundings including the adjacent low-rise residential tree-lined streets primarily composed of single-family homes, some as early as the late Victorian period and others dating from the early twentieth century. Together the industrial buildings and residential streets are part of a cohesive neighbourhood which maintains its particular identity established nearly a century ago.</p>\n<p>Heritage Attributes:</p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the property at 462 Eastern Avenue are:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of Eastern Avenue between Booth and Logan avenues<br />2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the principal four-storey building, with its east and west end bays raised a half storey, and a two-storey, five bay addition to the east.<br />3.&nbsp; The materials, comprising dark red and red brick cladding with stone details<br />4.&nbsp; The brick pilasters on the Booth, Eastern and Logan avenues elevations<br />5.&nbsp; The bands of vertical brick soldier courses running across the tops of window openings and continuing as a decorative band between pilasters<br />6.&nbsp; The stone window sills which span from between the pilasters and have been cut to have angled slopes as well as being blocks at the base of the brick walls<br />7.&nbsp; The stone sills running at the base of the pilasters on all three elevations on Booth, Eastern and Logan avenues<br />8.&nbsp; The stone base at grade, currently painted over<br />9.&nbsp; The stone caps and decorative, triple, vertical stone bands featured at the top of the pilasters with a longer central band<br />10.&nbsp; The shallow pediment at the centre of the four-storey building with its circular stone disk<br />11.&nbsp; The windows on the principal, four-storey building which include wide horizontal windows at the first and second floor levels seen on the elevations facing Booth and Eastern avenue<br />12.&nbsp; The pairs of windows at the third and fourth floor levels of the four-storey building, all floors of the raised east end bay and the two storey addition, on all three elevations facing Booth, Eastern and Logan Avenues<br />13.&nbsp; The pair of vertical windows at the west end of the Eastern Avenue elevation which have been bricked in<br />14.&nbsp; The loading bay opening at the base of the eastern tower and the adjacent ground-level doorway<br />Please note: The numerous additions to the rear are not included.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 1, 2018, which is May 31, 2018.

City Council direct the Executive Director, Municipal Licensing and Standards, the Medical Officer of Health, the Executive Director, Social Development, Finance and Administration, the Director, Environment and Energy, and the Chief Resilience Officer, in consultation with other appropriate divisions, to establish a working group to identify strategies to address excessive indoor temperatures in apartment buildings, including a review of the feasibility of the following, and to report back to the Tenant Issues Committee in the fourth quarter of 2019:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">a. require that all existing apartment buildings provide air conditioned units or an air conditioned cool room in the building;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">b. require that all new apartment buildings have air conditioning and add measures that enable passive cooling; and</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">c. require that all apartment buildings undergo retrofits, such as new windows, heavy-duty screens, cladding and other passive and active cooling systems, and updated heating systems to mitigate the negative health impacts of heat on tenants.</p>\n<p>2. City Council request the provincial and federal governments expand financial incentives, including grants and low-cost loans, for owners of apartment buildings to undertake retrofits that would improve indoor temperatures and increase access to cool rooms for tenants, and to provide guidance to support this goal.</p>\n<p>3. City Council amend Municipal Code Chapter 497, Heating, to clarify that landlords do not need to turn the heat on between September 15 and June 1 where the unit is a minimum of 21 degrees Celsius without heating.</p>\n<p>4.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that City Council intends to amend former City of Toronto By-law 960-88, a by-law designating the property at 85 Richmond Street West as being of architectural value or interest, to update the cultural heritage values and attributes according to the 2005 amendments to the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Federal Building</strong></p>\n<p>The Federal Building meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual values.</p>\n<p>Located on the southwest corner of Sheppard Street, the property at 85 Richmond Street West contains the Federal Building, an 11-storey office building that was completed in 1923 by Yolles and Rotenberg, developers and general contractors, according to the design of American architect C. Howard Crane.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The Federal Building has design value as a commercial building from the interwar era that is distinguished as a first-generation &ldquo;skyscraper&rdquo; with Beaux-Arts styling while employing contemporary materials and construction methods. It was completed as the largest fire-proof office building in Canada.</p>\n<p>The Federal Building is valued for its historical association with the American architect, C. Howard Crane. Following his training with the notable Albert Kahn Associates in Detroit, Crane was recognized internationally for the movie theatres he designed across North America and in Britain. While Crane accepted commissions for other building types in the United States and Canada, the Federal Building is his only documented office building in Canada.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of the property at 85 Richmond Street West is also through its connection to Yolles and Rotenberg, the contractors and developers who constructed the Federal Building. The company was co-founded by Louis S. Yolles, who is also distinguished as one of the first practicing Jewish architects in Ontario. Following the completion of the Federal Building, Yolles and his business partner, lawyer Harry Rotenberg commissioned other heritage buildings in the Financial District, including the National Building (1926) at 347 Bay Street, the Sterling Tower (1928) at 372 Bay Street and the Yolles and Rotenberg Building (1954) at 111 Richmond Street West.</p>\n<p>The property at 85 Richmond Street West is also linked to the ongoing development of the Financial District in the early 20th century when the area west of Bay Street was laid out according to urban design principles identified with the City Beautiful Movement. A 1911 plan introduced &ldquo;Federal Avenue,&rdquo; a ceremonial boulevard designed to link Union Station with a new public building on Queen Street West. With the outbreak of World War I, the project remained unbuilt, but was recognized in the naming of the Federal Building.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Federal Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on the southwest corner of Richmond and Sheppard streets where it contributes to the character of the Financial District. Placed east of the Yolles and Rotenberg Building (1954) at 111 Richmond Street West, the Federal Building adjoins other landmark skyscrapers located west of Bay Street, including the adjoining Graphic Arts Building (1911) at 73 Richmond Street West, the Concourse Building (1928) at 100 Adelaide Street West, and the Victory Building (1930) at 78 Richmond Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Federal Building at 85 Richmond Street West are:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southwest corner of Sheppard Street</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 11-storey U-shaped plan with the light well (south)</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; The materials, with the concrete construction, the limestone and brick cladding, and the stone, brick and metal detailing</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp; The flat roofline (the pressed metal cornice was removed)</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation, extending 9 bays on Richmond Street West, and the east side elevation, extending five bays on Sheppard Street, with the two-storey base and the nine-storey shaft</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp; On the north elevation, the main entrance, which is centered in the wall in a two-storey surround with the reed moulding, the entablature and the cartouche (the original doors have been replaced)</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp; The organization of the north and east elevations by the piers and, above the second, third and ninth stories, the band courses</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp; The fenestration on the north and east elevations, with the oversized commercial openings in the first (ground) floor, the tripartite Chicago-style windows in the second storey, the symmetrically-placed pairs of flat-headed openings with the stone sills in the upper floors, and the spandrels</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp; The west side elevation, which is viewed from Richmond Street West, and the rear (south) elevation, which is viewed from Sheppard Street</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp; On the interior, the north lobby with the ceiling with the coffers and mouldings, the brass fittings, the bracketed wall-hung light fixtures, and the stainless-steel elevator doors with the decorative brass motifs</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the amendment of the designating by-law may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 11, 2018, which is May 11, 2018.

In 1936, the Canadian Bank of Commerce (known as CIBC since 1961) purchased the building. In 1954 the building was extended with a rear one-storey wing and renovated interiors to the designs of the architect M. Coleman. In 2002, the property was sold and redeveloped as &ldquo;The Treasury&rdquo; a second-hand store, now a residential property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The building at 2896 Dundas Street West has design value as a fine example of an early twentieth century bank in the Edwardian Classical style with a beautifully detailed main elevation featuring a stone portico with Tuscan Doric columns and banded piers, arched openings with moulded stone surrounds and an inventive rendering of a traditional entablature and cornice indicating its architects had a sophisticated knowledge of the classical language.</p>\n<p>The bank building has historical value as it is associated with the early history and development of the West Toronto Junction as a village and town prior to its amalgamation with the City of Toronto in 1909. It has historic associations with the Molson brewery family, who founded The Molsons Bank in 1853 in Montreal as well as the Canadian Bank of Commerce (later the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce). Both banks were part of the early history of the West Toronto Junction, the emergence of its main street business section as each had opened a branch as early as 1888 and 1893 respectively. The building is valued for its association with the successful Toronto architectural partnership of Langley &amp; Howland whose commissions included branch banks across the city and the province and were also the architects of three other Molsons Bank branches built between 1909 and 1913.</p>\n<p>Situated on the north side of Dundas Street West, west of Keele Street, the property at 2896 Dundas Street West has contextual value as it maintains the late19th-early 20th century Main Street pattern of two-three storey buildings with a mix of brick shop-fronts with residential accommodation and monumental stone banks and post offices that characterised the west Junction throughout its history and represents an urban pattern of settlement typical of Main Streets in suburbs and small towns throughout Ontario. The use of stone cladding and full-height columns and piers on the elevation contributes to the streetscape with its grand institutional character and ties in with other Junction bank buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Molsons Bank is one of the landmarks which punctuates the streetscape with its material, forms and details and contributes to the historic character and context of the Junction.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Molsons/CIBC Bank building are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The placement and orientation of the building on its property on the north side of Dundas Street West, west of Keele Street</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The setting of the bank building which includes the sidewalk in front of its principal (south) elevation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The scale, form and massing of the two-storey, flat-roofed, bank building</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;On the principal, south elevation, the arrangement of a three-bay fa&ccedil;ade with a central entrance flanked by windows in the outer bays, with two columns separating the bays and two outer piers at the outer corners</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The primary material cladding of the elevation is limestone</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The stone details include the unfluted Tuscan Doric columns and two broad rusticated piers also with Tuscan Doric capitals all of which are set on a raised bas</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;Across the top of the columns and piers is an entablature with a plain frieze with a pair of triglyphs with guttae at each end and a projecting moulded cornice above with mutules on its underside</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;At the top of the elevation is a stone balustrade with bulbous balusters between panelled piers whose thickness corresponds to the columns and piers below</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The wall cladding features a smooth ashlar stone which is relieved with rectangular blocks and a continuous moulded string course beneath the upper windows and a relief in the surface with decorative panels below the windows</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;On the principal elevation, the ground floor openings feature round headed openings with moulded arch surrounds and keystones for the central door and flanking windows.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull;The three upper level windows feature flat-headed, square window openings</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Rosemary Mackenzie, Administrator, Etobicoke York Community Council, Etobicoke Civic Centre, Main Floor, 399 The West Mall, Toronto, ON M9C 2Y2 within thirty days of April 9, 2018, which is May 9, 2018.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and  City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1522728000000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 64 Woodlawn Avenue West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>Caldecott House</p>\n<p>The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p>The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West contains a 2&frac12;-storey detached house form building that is located on the north side of the street, west of Yonge Street and south of St. Clair Avenue West. It was developed on a subdivision of the former &ldquo;Woodlawn&rdquo; estate along Walker and Woodlawn avenues, which was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1888. The dwelling at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West was constructed in 1906 for Toronto businessman, Stapleton Caldecott and his wife, Emma Arnold Caldecott according to the designs of the notable Toronto architect, Eden Smith. For over 50 years, the site was owned by James H. Swan, whose family had acquired other allotments on Woodlawn Avenue West in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is valued for its design as a fine representative example of an early 20th century house form building designed in the Period Revival style influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement as interpreted by architect Eden Smith. It is distinguished by its asymmetrical plan with the projecting bays, the complicated roofline with the gables and the distinctive canted chimneys, and the decorative wood strapwork.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Caldecott House is through its identification with Toronto architect Eden Smith, who designed the dwelling. The English-born architect is noted for his distinctive designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts ideals of William Morris and his circle. In Toronto, following his high-profile commission for St. Thomas&rsquo;s Church (1892) on Huron Street, Smith focused on designing houses in high-end neighbourhoods and enclaves throughout the city, among them Wychwood Park, the neighbourhood inspired by North American artists&rsquo; colonies, which was amongst the first Heritage Conservation Districts in Toronto.</p>\n<p>The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is also valued for its association with its original owner, Robert Stapleton Pitt Caldecott (1836-1907), who commissioned the house. Caldecott was a highly regarded businessman who served as the president of the Toronto Board of Trade and was considered an expert in international trade.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Caldecott House is valued for its contribution to the character of the area, which originated as William Hume Blake&rsquo;s 19th-century &ldquo;Woodlawn&rdquo; estate and was developed afterward as an upscale residential enclave that was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1888. The property at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting where, with its neighbours to the west, the Caldecott House is set back from the street line on a slight rise of land.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Caldecott House at 64 Woodlawn Avenue West are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey house form building</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The cross-gable roof with the gable on the south slope, the canted brick corner chimneys, and the gabled wall dormer (south)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing (the brickwork has been painted), including the wood strapwork in the gables</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The principal (south) elevation, with the main entrance, which is set in a flat-headed surround with sidelights under an open gable-roofed porch between single- and two-storey bay windows</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The side elevations (east and west), which are viewed from Woodlawn Avenue West, including the two-storey bay window on the east wall</p>\n<p>Note: the rear (north) wing and the detached garage (1929) at the south end of the property are not identified as heritage attributes.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 3, 2018, which is May 3, 2018. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>",

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 352 Adelaide Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act</p>\n<p>Reasons for Designation</p>\n<p>The property at 352 Adelaide Street West (Alexander Engraving Co) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.Description<br />The property at 352 Adelaide Street West contains the Alexander Engraving Co. building, completed in 1909, a three storey, commercial warehouse building with brick cladding. The property is located in the King-Spadina area.</p>\n<p>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</p>\n<p>The Alexander Engraving Co. building has design value as a representative of the commercial warehouse type with mill construction which is evident in the regular disposition of the windows reflective of the internal structural grid and the departure with the large ground floor window designed for display and advertising.</p>\n<p>The building has historic value as it is associated with the evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood&rsquo;s history as a commercial and industrial district which supported a range of commercial interests including small family-run businesses. Originally associated with the Alexander Engraving Company, from as early as 1920 the building was occupied by the Zuckerman family who operated the Novelty Embroidery Company, later known as Toronto Quilting and Embroidery Ltd. which by 1982 was known as Doubletex Inc. which now has branches in numerous Canadian and American cities.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act  R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and  City of Toronto, Province of Ontario",
    "noticeDate": 1520312400000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 422 and 424 Wellington Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.<br />Reasons for Designation<br />The properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.<br />Description<br />The properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West are located on the north side of the street, between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west), where they are setback from the wide boulevard and contain a pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached house form buildings. Completed in 1888 and attributed to builder Robert Sweet Crabb, the properties were transferred individually to William McLeish, a prominent Toronto realtor, and Charles Powell, manager of the Temperance Colonization Society. 422 and 424 Wellington Street West were listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005 and located in the proposed King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District.<br />Statement of Cultural Heritage Value<br />The properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West have cultural heritage value as well-crafted examples of semi-detached house form buildings in the King-Spadina neighbourhood that are distinguished by their Queen Anne Revival styling. The McLeish-Powell Houses are indicative of the style with the picturesque silhouettes, intricate rooflines, variety of fenestration, and mixture of materials that includes decorative terra cotta.<br />The McLeish-Powell Houses have associative value for their contribution to the understanding of the historical evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where they were developed on part of the Military Reserve that was established in the 18th century west of the Town of York and subsequently subdivided and sold in the early 19th century to accommodate the expansion of the City of Toronto. The plan of subdivision incorporated two important public squares (Victoria Memorial Square, with its military burial ground, and Clarence Square) that were connected by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place where the McLeish-Powell Houses were amongst the elaborate residences completed in the late 1800s. The houses were part of the transformation of the King-Spadina neighbourhood from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904. While most of the neighbouring house form buildings were replaced by large-scale warehouses, the McLeish-Powell Houses survived and were converted to commercial and industrial uses in the World War II era. They provide an important reminder of the late-19th century upscale residential appearance of Wellington Place before it was absorbed into the extension of Wellington Street West, west of Spadina Avenue.<br />Contextually, the properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West support the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre. In King-Spadina, the McLeish-Powell Houses reflect the development in the late 1800s of the section of Wellington Street West originally known as Wellington Place as an upscale residential enclave that was enveloped by early 20th century industrial warehouses. Situated in-between warehouse buildings, the McLeish-Powell Houses are historically and visually linked to their surroundings where they are the finest of the small group of surviving 19th-century residential buildings along the thoroughfare.<br />Heritage Attributes<br />The heritage attributes of the McLeish-Powell Houses on the properties at 422 and 424 Wellington Street West are:<br />1.&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the buildings on the north side of Wellington Street West between Spadina Avenue and Portland Street</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached house form buildings with the rectangular-shaped plans above the stone foundation.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; The hipped-gable roof covering the buildings with the gabled and hipped dormers, including the trio on the south slope, with the decorative wood bargeboard and brackets</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone, wood and terra cotta detailing</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp; The arrangement of the principal (south) elevations of the houses as mirror images, where the main entrances with the flat transoms are placed side-by-side in the centre of the first (ground) floor beneath the pairs of round-arched window openings in the second and attic stories (the doors have been replaced)</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp; On the south elevations, in the outer bays, the three-storey bay windows with the segmental-arched and the flat-headed openings</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, which repeat the fenestration, including the three-storey bay windows</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp; The detailing on the door and window openings, with the continuous stone lintels and sills, and the brick voussoirs with the stone drip moulds and keystones</p>\n<p>9.&nbsp; The terra cotta detailing, incorporating panels with scrollwork and animal heads above the bay windows and in the roundel on the south centre bay</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 6, 2018, which is April 5, 2018.

    "noticeDate": 1518757200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p><strong>Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 505 Balliol Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong><br />The property at 505 Balliol Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br />Located on the south side of the street between Mount Pleasant Road and Bayview Avenue in the Davisville neighbourhood, the property at 505 Balliol Street contains the Page House and Grocery Store, a one-and-a-half storey, gable-roofed structure completed by 1889 and adapted to function as a neighbourhood store from 1924-1951. The property at 505 Balliol Street was identified as having potential heritage value in the &ldquo;Midtown in Focus: Cultural Heritage Resource Assessment (2017).&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong><br />The Page House and Grocery Store has design value as a representative example of the classic 19th century Ontario house which comprised a one-and-a-half storey gable-roofed building with a dormer gable and entrance centred on the principle elevation. It is also valued for the adaptation of the house to include a local neighbourhood grocery store at ground floor which is indicated by the later addition of the two large bay windows on the principal elevation.</p>\n<p>As one of the earliest and rare surviving 1880s houses on Balliol Street, the Page House and Grocery Store has historical value for its association with the Page family who occupied the house for over 75 years. It is valued for its association with the Davis family, the historic evolution of the Davisville neighbourhood and the late 19th century subdivision which included the creation of Balliol and Merton streets. It is also valued as it represents a pattern of urban living which evolved in the late 19th century and continued beyond the mid-20th century that relied on the small neighbourhood grocery store on a residential side street, accessible by foot, a common type across the City of Toronto, now increasingly rare.</p>\n<p>Contextually the property at 505 Balliol Street supports the remaining historic character of Balliol Street as it developed as a residential street in the late 19th century. In its scale, form and details, the building maintains the link with the original 19th century character of the first houses on the street, the majority of which have been demolished and replaced. In its transformation as a local convenience store, serving the adjacent community connected by the streets perpendicular to Balliol, Forsyth Road, Forman Avenue, Martin Road and Cleveland Street, it is historically and functionally linked to the final development of the Davisville neighbourhood in the early 20th century. As a local community amenity, with its distinctive form and proximity to the street edge, the property is a local landmark.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the building at 505 Balliol Street are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the south side of Balliol Street between Mount Pleasant Road and Bayview Avenue</li>\n<li>The scale, form and massing of the one-and-a-half storey house-form building with its gable roof and gable dormer &ndash; this includes the front gable-roofed volume of the house</li>\n<li>The principal (north) elevation with its central door flanked by two symmetrical windows with a central gable dormer above</li>\n<li>The windows on the principal (north) elevation including the two bay windows and their upper lights and the round-headed dormer window with its one-over-one double-hung sash.</li>\n<li>The projecting hipped roof which links the two bay windows together.</li>\n<li>The two-over-two double-hung sash window on the second floor of the side (west) elevation</li>\n<li>The two-over-two double-hung sash window on the second floor of the side (east) elevation</li>\n<li>Original exterior building cladding</li>\n<li>The brick chimney on the east elevation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: The rear south elevation and the rear wing, all porches and decks are not included in the attributes.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of February 16, 2018, which is March 19, 2018.

    "subheading": "In the Matter of the Ontario Heritage Act R.S.O. 1990, Chapter 0.18 and City of Toronto, Province of Ontario ",
    "noticeDate": 1518066000000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 1755 Bayview Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1755 Bayview Avenue (including the entry address at 1757 Bayview Avenue) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1755 Bayview Avenue contains a four-unit, two-storey brick and stone-clad apartment building, which is part of a unique set of ten properties of similar design, owned and developed by Henry H. Talbot, builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and designed by the architect W. Breden Galbraith on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>Constructed in 1936-37, the four-unit apartment building with a single entrance at 1755 Bayview Avenue has design value as a representative example of a Tudor Revival variation on the Arts and Crafts, the style associated with the Garden Suburb aesthetic, featuring half-timber in the roof gables, paired bay windows with stone bases and long casement windows and a front door with an arched stone surround with a keystone and quoins. The design value of this property is amplified by its being one of the same four-unit apartment building typology with a variety of styles associated with the Arts and Crafts Style, constructed as a set on the east side of Bayview Avenue.</p>\n<p>The property is valued for its association with the Leaside Garden Suburb developed in 1912 by the Canadian National Railway and designed by the landscape architect Frederick Todd Gage. It contributes to an understanding of the development and growth of Leaside in the 1930s which integrated a variety of housing typologies addressing various income levels and household types. It demonstrates the variety of the work undertaken by Henry H. Talbot, a locally-based builder and Mayor of Leaside (1938-1947) and it reflects the work and ideas of the well-known residential designer W. Breden Galbraith.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 1755 Bayview Avenue is important in defining and maintaining the consistent character created with the other nine, adjacent, four-unit apartment buildings. Their 1930s period detail, reflecting the Arts and Crafts influence, contributes to and maintains the overall character of the Leaside Garden Suburb. The four-unit apartment buildings maintain not only the period and architectural quality of scale and style but they also contribute to a distinctive social quality in Leaside&rsquo;s planning and built form which provided a wide range of housing typologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the building at 1755 Bayview Avenue are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&bull; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Bayview Avenue between Parkhurst Boulevard and Eglinton Avenue East<br />&bull; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey, four-unit apartment block built on a rectangular plan with projecting bay windows with a unifying roof and a hipped roof with three dormer gables on its principal west elevation<br />&bull; The symmetrical arrangement of the bays on the principal (west) elevation with larger windows and gables flanking the smaller gable, central window and main door<br />&bull; The cladding of the principal (west) elevation with its variegated red brick cladding, stone-clad bays and stone surrounds on the entrance door and half-timbering in the dormer gables with bargeboards with undulating profiles<br />&bull; The windows on the principal (west) elevation with the ground floor bay windows, with five vertical lights divided into square upper sections and rectangular lower sections, the second storey windows with three vertical lights divided into square upper sections and rectangular lower sections and the central second storey window and the decorative pattern of muntin bars in the upper window sections<br />&bull; Decorative wood trim at the eaves above the bay windows including paired wood brackets and a dentil course and the paired wood brackets featured at the second floor level<br />&bull; The single main entrance with its segmentally-arched panelled door with glazed openings surrounded by stone quoins and a keystone<br />&bull; The cladding of variegated red brick on the side elevations and the rusticated concrete block at the raised basement level</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Francine Adamo, Administrator, North York Community Council, North York Civic Centre, Main Floor, 5100 Yonge Street, Toronto, Ontario M2N 5V7, within thirty days of February 8, 2018, which is March 12, 2018.
