    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council stated its intention to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 28 &ndash; 30 Langley Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>28 &ndash; 30 LANGLEY AVENUE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue contains a pair of 2&frac12;-storey semi-detached houses that, following the issuance of a building permit to the property owner and contractor William C. Jones in November 1892 that identified George Martel Miller as the architect, were under construction the following year (1893).&nbsp; Standing vacant for five years, the semi-detached house at 28 Langley Avenue was first occupied in 1898 by Reverend Enoch Barker, a Congregational minister.&nbsp; The following year, Louis J. Thomas and his family began a lengthy tenancy of 30 Langley Avenue that lasted until Thomas's death in 1913.&nbsp; Subsequently, his widow, Jennie Rife Thomas, purchased the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue with both houses.&nbsp; Archival records indicate that the Thomas Estate retained the property until the 1950s when it was converted to a legal rooming house.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is valued for the exceptionally highly-crafted design of the pair of semi-detached houses in the Queen Anne Revival style that was popular at the end of the 19th century and identified by the mixture of materials, intricate rooflines and variety of architectural detailing.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are particularly distinguished by the composition anchored by corner towers with turrets and original stained glass windows, and the sandstone cladding covering most of the principal (south) elevations.</p>\n<p>The William C. Jones Houses are historically associated with George Martel Miller (1854-1933), the Toronto architect who is credited with their design.&nbsp; In solo practice in Toronto for nearly half a century where the Gladstone Hotel (1894) on Queen Street West was amongst his early projects, Miller became known for his commissions for the famous Massey family, particularly the iconic Massey Music Hall (1894, in association with Cleveland architect, Sidney R. Badgley).&nbsp; Miller's extensive portfolio included residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming neighbourhoods where the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue is a rare documented example of his work in Riverdale.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 28-30 Langley Avenue has cultural heritage value for its role in maintaining, supporting and defining the historical character of the street and the adjoining area as it developed as a middle-class enclave in Riverdale with well-crafted detached and semi-detached houses from the late-19th and early-20th century.&nbsp; The William C. Jones Houses are also historically, visually and physically linked to their setting on Langley Avenue on one of the original few lots not subdivided where they stand prominent in the street with the grandeur of their scale, roofline and distinctive architectural detailing.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the William C. Jones Houses at 28-30 Langley Avenue are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the buildings on the north side of the street, east of Broadview Avenue</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey plans, with the sandstone bases with the window openings (south)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering the buildings, the hipped roof (south) with the flared eaves, the metal finial and the corner towers (southwest and southeast), the cross-gable roofs (east and west) with the enclosed gables and the wood detailing, the gambrel roof (north), the shed-roof dormers (east and west), and the brick chimneys</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick and sandstone cladding, and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevations, which are arranged as mirror images with the main entrances placed side-by-side in the first (ground) floor and accessed through round-arched portals with sandstone detailing (beneath the transoms, the doors have been replaced, as well as the steps leading to the entries)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevations, in the second storey, the flat-headed openings with transoms that are protected by an open porch with a classical column</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The corner towers (southeast and southwest) with the round-arched openings in the first (ground) floor, some of which contain stained glass windows, the flat-headed window openings in the upper stories, the conical roofs with the extended eaves with brackets, and the metal finials</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; The sandstone detailing on the south elevations, with the lintels, continuous sills and band courses</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side elevations (east and west) with the brick detailing and the two-storey bay windows with the flat-headed openings, the brick flat arches and the stone sills</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 17, 2019, which is June 17, 2019.

    "noticeDate": 1557979200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 440 Unwin Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 440 Unwin Avenue, (Richard L. Hearn Generating Station), is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located in the Port Lands, on the north side of Unwin Avenue, between Cherry and Leslie streets, the property contains the Richard L. Hearn Generating Station, a massive brick-clad structure, 41-metres high, with an adjacent concrete chimney stack of 213 metres visible from multiple points in the city.&nbsp; The property also included an area for a switching station and transmission towers, a large coal pit, railway spurs, various outbuildings used for managing water intake and discharge and ancillary structures&nbsp;&nbsp; and a formally landscaped drive to the main, west-facing, entrance.&nbsp; The station was designed in 1949 by the Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corporation, opened in 1951 with plans for an extension which was completed in 1961. The concrete chimney stack was added to the property in 1971, replacing the previous eight chimney stacks.&nbsp; The station was decommissioned in 1983.&nbsp; The station interiors were initially transformed to accommodate film and television studio production and subsequently stabilized between 2014 and 2016 to host large public events such as Luminato.&nbsp;&nbsp; The building's context has evolved on its south side with a waterfront park which includes the Martin Goodman Trail and the adjacent Leslie Street Spit with its renowned abundance of animal and plant species, the Tommy Thomson Trail and the Outer Harbour Marina.</p>\n<p>The property was included on the City's Heritage Register in 2003. The Province of Ontario included it on the List of Provincial Heritage Properties in 2016 until November 2018 when the site was sold.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Hearn Generating Station has design value as a rare representative of a mid-20th century, steam power plant whose composition of diverse rectangular forms and single chimney stack is representative of the original processes which converted coal to steam and then electricity.&nbsp; The generating station exhibits a high degree of artistic merit in the principle, west, elevation of the Hearn which unites the three, large, rectilinear power-plant volumes with the lower administration block through a skillful application of the mid-century Style Moderne style.&nbsp; The artistic effect of the style is based in the simple geometric forms, the smooth, unrelieved, brick-clad surfaces which are offset by the dramatic linear patterns of the vertical banding of the modernist glass-block windows, framed with limestone piers, on the plant sections and the contrasting horizontal limestone banding around the windows of the administration block.&nbsp; Set at the top of a limestone staircase, the central principal entrance, with its combination of smooth limestone piers and the use of metal alloys in its curving canopy and paired entry doors, signals at once both the traditional gravitas of a civic institution combined with the modernity that is evident in the rest of the west elevation.&nbsp; In its structural capacity to provide the foundations and structure to both house, and support, the equipment of this vastly-scaled power generating station, along with its slip-form concrete chimney of 213 metres, the Hearn displays a high degree of technical achievement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hearn property is valued for its historic value and association as power station built at the end of World War II by Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEPCO), the provincial body now known as the Ontario Power Generation (OPG), to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for the City of Toronto for the booming post-war economy.&nbsp; With evolving supply and environmental concerns, the commission replaced coal burning with natural gas and installed the 213m chimney in 1971.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Hearn is significant as it is associated with the development of the 1912 Harbour Commission plan for the Port Lands as a newly created waterfront which was intended to support shipping, industry, as well as, waterfront parks and recreation. Its location in the Port Lands enabled the supply of coal and water necessary for the generating station processes.</p>\n<p>The property also has value for its association with Richard L. Hearn, Chief Engineer and Chairman of (HEPCO).&nbsp; An award-winning engineer, for over 40 years, Hearn made a substantial contribution to the development of Ontario's power supply through the construction of numerous facilities, two of which broke records for size, in the completion of the first synthetic rubber plant, considered to a great Canadian construction achievement, as well as for the development of atomic energy uses for peacetime and nuclear energy.&nbsp; In 1967 he was appointed the Chancellor of Brock University and received the Order of Canada in 1973.</p>\n<p>The Hearn is valued as it reflects the work of the engineering firm of Stone &amp; Webster, established in Boston in 1889 and from the beginning specializing in the design, construction and management of power plants becoming leaders in the field to the point where it is estimated that 20% of all power generators in the United States originated with this firm.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Hearn is valued as it defines, supports and maintains the historic industrial character of the Port Lands.&nbsp; Initially designed as a coal-based generating station, relying on the supply of coal via rail links and water from the shipping channel, the Hearn was typical of the industrial uses intended for the Port Lands.&nbsp; Since its closure in 1983, it has been characteristic of the regeneration and adaptive reuse of the historic Port Lands structures as it has been leased by a film studio and more recently used as a temporary setting for the annual Luminato festival.</p>\n<p>Located on the north side of Unwin Avenue since 1949, the generating station has been historically, visually and functionally linked to the industrial and institutional uses as well as the parklands and recreational trails of the Port Lands and the Leslie Street Spit for over 70 years.&nbsp; With its impressive mass and 213-metre chimney, the Hearn is a landmark, a \"symbol of the Port Lands, seen from multiple vantage points.&nbsp; It terminates the southern views down Carlaw Avenue, as well as Logan Avenue and Bouchette Street.&nbsp; The view of the chimney has also been anticipated to terminate Broadview Avenue when it is extended.&nbsp; From the east and west the chimney is viewed from both ends of Unwin Avenue at Leslie and Cherry streets.&nbsp; At a city scale, it is a contributing feature of Toronto's waterfront skyline.</p>\n<p><strong>The heritage attributes of the Richard L. Hearn Generating Station are:</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EXTERIOR</span></p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the north side of Unwin Avenue between Cherry and Leslie streets in the Port Lands</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the generating station which is composed of four parallel rectangular volumes of different heights (with a maximum height of 41 metres) enclosing the generating station functions, with a fourth three-storey administration block on the west elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which is primarily brick, with a concrete base, vertical limestone piers and bands surrounding the windows and glass block glazing, limestone coping bands at the roof line and piers at the principal entrance, with glass block and aluminum-alloy double-hung sash window frames</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the principal, west elevation, with the three horizontal bands of double-hung sash windows on the three-storey administration block, and the composition of the vertical panels of glass block, three on the central boiler hall, and two on the turbine hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal entrance on the west elevation with it projecting aluminum-alloy clad canopy and pair of doors, framed by two limestone piers with curving plans and the staircase with its limestone block balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The south elevation with its vertical and horizontal panels of glass block at the upper levels of the boiler hall and the fan room and the lower horizontal bands of windows, some with metal hoods, on the fan room and the pattern of bands of windows with upper square openings on the 1961 extension and the hooded metal duct vents at the upper level of the boiler room</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north elevation with its various extensions and accretions including the single story bay with brick buttresses, additional brick bays with stone copings, the two triangular bay windows, the metal hoods on horizontal window openings, the projecting periscope-type cylindrical ducts and the entryway originally used to accommodate the railway spur</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east elevation with its narrow horizontal bands of windows and unrelieved walls including the single-storey extension and the metal clad tower and its connection to the main building</p>\n<p>INTERIOR</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spatial volumes of the boiler hall, turbine hall and fan hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steel structure of the boiler hall, including the long east-west multi-storey passage through the steel structure</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concrete structures and steel beams of the turbine hall</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal entry lobby with its limestone cladding and stair with a metal balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The control room configurations built-in desks with control panels as well as wall-mounted control panels&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ANCILLARY BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 213-metre slip-form concrete chimney stack</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various outbuildings and structures including the entry gate house and the four outbuildings adjacent to the shipping channel</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal tower and shed on the east end of the Hearn&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SETTING</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally the area surrounding the Hearn which contains elements relating to its use as a power generating station</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west side of the Hearn, the driveway leading from Unwin Avenue with the remaining circular drive at the entrance encompassing a circular planted area and the hedges planted along the west elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area for the switching station and transmission towers on the north side of the Hearn extending from the building face to the edge of the shipping basin</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The railway tracks which remain on the site</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 15, 2019, which is June 17, 2019.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 482 and 488 Wellington Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>482 WELLINGTON STREET WEST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 482 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1907 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A. Harvey.&nbsp; The property, along with the adjoining site at 488 Wellington Street West (which contains a complementary warehouse built in 1918), was retained by M. Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.</p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West was included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 2005.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 482 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation, the sombre red brick cladding, the symmetrical placement of the openings, and the modest classical detailing with the banded brick pilasters and the brick corbelling beneath the south roofline.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the property at 482 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.</p>\n<p>The Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West is valued for its association with Toronto architect J. A. (James Arthur) Harvey, who was particularly noted for his solo practice that began in the late-19th century and focused on residential buildings in Toronto's up-and-coming residential neighbourhoods, as well as the first generation of walk-up apartment blocks in the city.&nbsp; The property at 482 Wellington Street West contains one of Harvey's rare documented commissions for an industrial building.</p>\n<p>The property at 482 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West.&nbsp; It was among the earliest warehouses constructed on the north side of the street.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 482 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 482 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the Granatstein Building (1918) at 488 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 482 Wellington Street West are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork on the south end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays by the pilasters with brick banding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, above the first (ground) floor (which has been altered), the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched window openings with the brick and stone detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, with the flat-headed window openings that are viewed from Wellington Street West</p>\n<p>The glazed rooftop addition, dating to the 1990s, and the ground-floor link to the adjoining building at 488 Wellington Street West are not identified as heritage attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>488 WELLINGTON STREET WEST</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Spadina Avenue (east) and Portland Street (west) in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 488 Wellington Street West contains a five-storey warehouse dating to 1918 that was commissioned by Mandel Granatstein for his rag processing and junk dealing businesses and designed by Toronto architect J.A.

Granatstein and Sons of Toronto Limited until 1982.</p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 488 Wellington Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of Edwardian Classicism applied to an early-20th century warehouse.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building displays the hallmarks of the style with the tripartite organization of the principal (south) elevation with the extended centre bay, the sombre red brick cladding, and the symmetrical placement of the openings.&nbsp; It is particularly distinguished by the artificial stone applied for the base (south), the classically-detailed south entrance, the extended lintels and sills on the flat-headed window openings on the south elevation (that extend to the southerly bays on the east and west side walls), and the cornice with the dome-shaped finials at the south end of the flat roofline.&nbsp; The Granatstein Building (1918) was noted at the time of its construction for its innovative (at that time) concrete structure that was exposed on the side walls with the grid-like placement of the fenestration.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the property at 488 Wellington Street West is through its connection with Mandel Granatstein, who commissioned the warehouse as part of a complex of industrial buildings.&nbsp; Granatstein was a Polish emigrant who established rag processing and junk dealing enterprises in The Ward, the Toronto neighbourhood that was the centre of the Jewish community in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.&nbsp; By 1907 when Granatstein unveiled his first custom-built warehouse in King-Spadina, he was regarded as one of the most successful Jewish businessmen in the city.&nbsp; Granatstein was noted for commissioning Benjamin Brown, Toronto's first practicing Jewish architect, to design his family residence on St. George Street (which included a retractable roof for Sukkoth observances), as well as for his role as a co-founder and supporter of the Henry Street Shul, the forerunner to the Beth Jacob Synagogue.&nbsp; Until his death in 1945, Granatstein operated his businesses with his three sons, who retained the adjoining warehouses at 482 and 488 Wellington Street West until 1982.</p>\n<p>The Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West is also valued for its association with the Toronto architectural firm of Hynes, Feldman and Watson, which had a short but notable practice beginning in 1915 that was headed by architect J. P. (James Patrick Hynes) and interrupted by the untimely death in 1919 of Isadore Feldman and the subsequent departure to New York City of Albert Edward Watson.&nbsp; While working together, the architects designed three venues for the Allen Theatre chain (including the extant building now known as the Danforth Music Hall), additions to St. Michael's Hospital and a small number of industrial edifices, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p>The property at 488 Wellington Street West has additional associative value for its contribution to the understanding of the historical development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which originated as part of the Military Reserve that was established in the late 1700s west of the Town of York and afterward subdivided and sold in the early-19th century to support the westward expansion of the community.&nbsp; The plan of subdivision incorporated two significant public spaces (Clarence Square and Victoria Memorial Square, the latter with a military burial ground) that were linked by an unusually wide boulevard named Wellington Place.&nbsp; As the area changed from a residential precinct to Toronto's main industrial centre after the Great Fire of 1904, most of the estate houses were replaced by large-scale factories and warehouses, including the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West that, with the earlier (1907) warehouse at 482 Wellington, formed a small-scale manufacturing complex in the block.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Granatstein Building at 488 Wellington Street West supports and maintains the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood as it developed and evolved in the 19th and 20th centuries from its origins as an institutional and residential community to the city&rsquo;s manufacturing centre.&nbsp; In King-Spadina, the property at 488 Wellington Street reflects the second phase of development of the former Wellington Place from a 19th-century residential enclave to an extension in the early 20th century of the industrial district where warehouses including the Granatstein Building lined most of the street.&nbsp; The subject building is historically and visually linked to its surroundings where it is adjoined by the original Granatstein Building (1907) at 482 Wellington Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Granatstein Building on the property at 488 Wellington Street West are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street, east of Portland Street</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the window openings (south) and the artificial stone facing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick and artificial stone detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the artificial stone cornice and dentils at the south end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into three bays, with an extended centre bay, by the pilasters that are surmounted by artificial stone dome-shaped finials</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, the placement of the main entrance in the left (west) bay of the first (ground) floor in a classically-detailed surround, and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed window openings with the continuous artificial stone lintels and sills</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west side elevations, where the grid-work pattern of flat-headed window openings in artificial stone surrounds is continued in the southerly bays</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of May 10, 2019, which is June 10. 2019.

    "noticeDate": 1555387200000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 280 Jarvis Street and 288-290 Jarvis Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>280 Jarvis Street:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 280 Jarvis Street, containing a semi-detached house-form building, is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located north of Gerrard Street East on the west side of Jarvis Street in the Garden District, the property at 280 Jarvis Street (originally known as 280-282 Jarvis Street) contains a pair of two-and-a-half storey, semi-detached houses, designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque Style and built as one of three pairs, extending from 280-290 Jarvis Street, by William Carlyle in 1890.&nbsp; In 1955 the semis at 280-282 Jarvis Street were converted to a lodging house and in 1972 were united as a single unit for office use at which time the property became known as 280 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; The design of the principal elevation of this pair of semis is mirrored by the other pair constructed at 288-290 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; In 1966, the pair at 284-286 Jarvis Street was demolished and their design as the centrepiece of the composition of the three buildings remains unknown. In 1973, City Council adopted a recommendation to include the property on the City's first Heritage Inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>William Carlyle's pair of semi-detached houses at 280 Jarvis Street is an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque.&nbsp; The style is evident in the picturesque massing of the principal, east elevation with its canted south-east corner rising as a turret, the broad archway framing recessed entries, the bay window at the second storey and the roofscape, with its octagonal, pyramid roof, dormers and two chimneys.&nbsp; The materials, sandstone, brick and terracotta, which is used in the shingles with scalloped or diamond-shaped tiles, decoratively-molded string courses and roof-top finials, are all quintessential Richardsonian Romanesque features. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the way the elevations of the pair is treated as a united whole so that each semi has different features rather than the predictable symmetry with identical doors and windows.&nbsp; Further, 280 and 288-290 Jarvis Street were constructed as mirror images of one another so that their prominent towers would anchor the outer corners of the whole assembly of the three pairs of semi-detached houses, creating a handsome group on Jarvis Street.</p>\n<p>The houses have historical value for their association with their builder, William Carlyle (1820-1903) a Scottish immigrant and successful contractor who was elected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward (1879-1890), served as Chairman of the Board of Works for the City of Toronto and was appointed Justice of the Peace for Toronto in 1884.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties have associative value as they contribute to an understanding of the historical development of Jarvis Street, representing the period of the street when it evolved as an attractive, late 19th-century avenue of broad, tree-lined boulevards faced with civic and religious institutions, grand estate homes and a range of more modest housing types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Carlyle houses are important for maintaining and supporting the late 19th-century character of Jarvis Street as well as contributing to the diversity of periods which the street presents as a record of its evolution.&nbsp; Located in the Garden District on the west side of the street on the block between Gerrard and Carlton streets, the two pairs of semi-detached houses maintain the setback and landscaped setting typical of 19th-century residential properties on Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Across the street, on the east side, are 19th-century buildings and a public space including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church (1875), the former Samuel Platt House (1849-50), Allan Gardens (1860) and St. Andrews Church (1878).&nbsp; To the north of the Carlyle houses, at 300 Jarvis Street, is the 1930 Art Deco Frontenac Arms hotel (now the Ramada Inn).&nbsp; To the south, at the intersection of Jarvis and Gerrard, is the Spanish-Revival Crown Hotel (now the Econo Lodge) at 335 Jarvis Street, and the Mid-century Modern, Juvenile and Family Courts Building at 311 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; These buildings and public spaces are just a small selection of the significantly rich collection of Toronto architecture and public amenities representing diverse periods, typologies and styles that characterise Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Constructed in 1890, the two pairs of semi-detached houses are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, contributing to the architectural diversity of this historically important Toronto thoroughfare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Carlyle houses at 280 Jarvis Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the west side of Jarvis, north of Gerrard Street East in the Garden District</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the house with the landscaped area in front of the house including the mature trees</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its rectangular plan with a canted, south-east corner rising as a turret, the east-facing sloped roof with an octagonal pyramid roof and two dormers, recessed entrance under a broad arch with its canted walls, rear, two-storey flat-roofed wing and two chimneys near the front, east elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which includes rusticated sandstone of two types, red brick and terracotta shingles in scalloped and diamond shapes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows openings including the ground floor openings of various rectangular sizes, the second floor bay window with its wood mouldings and panels, the&nbsp; pair of windows in the turret, single window on the canted corner and pair of smaller windows on the centre of the elevation, on the attic storey, the single window with three lights in the large dormer, the single opening in the small dormer and the pair of windows and single window in the turret</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The semis at 288-290 Jarvis Street were converted to lodging houses and then in 1969 they were converted for office use.&nbsp; The design of the principal elevation at this pair of semis is mirrored by the other pair constructed at 280 Jarvis Street (originally known as 280-282 Jarvis Street).&nbsp; In 1966, the pair at 284-286 Jarvis Street was demolished and their design as the centrepiece of the composition of the three buildings remains unknown.&nbsp; In 1973, City Council adopted a recommendation to include the properties on the City's first Heritage Inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>William Carlyle's pair of semi-detached houses at 288-290 Jarvis Street is an excellent example of the Richardsonian Romanesque.&nbsp; This style is evident in the picturesque massing of the principal, east elevation with its canted north-east corner rising as a turret, the broad archway framing recessed entries, the bay window at the second storey and the roofscape, with its octagonal pyramid roof and dormers.&nbsp; The materials, sandstone, brick and terracotta, which is used in the shingles with scalloped or diamond-shaped tiles, decoratively-molded string courses and roof-top finials, are all quintessential Richardsonian Romanesque features. A high degree of artistic merit is evident in the way the elevations of the pair is treated as a united whole so that each semi has different features rather than the predictable symmetry with identical doors and windows.&nbsp; Further, 280 and 288-290 Jarvis Street were constructed as mirror images of one another so that their prominent towers would anchor the outer corners of the whole assembly of the three pairs of semi-detached houses, creating a handsome group on Jarvis Street.</p>\n<p>The houses have historical value for their association with their builder, William Carlyle (1820-1903) a Scottish immigrant and successful contractor who was elected Alderman for St. Thomas's Ward (1879-1890), served as Chairman of the Board of Works for the City of Toronto and was appointed Justice of the Peace for Toronto in 1884.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties have associative value as they contribute to an understanding of the historical development of Jarvis Street, representing the period of the street when it evolved as an attractive late 19th-century avenue of broad, tree-lined boulevards faced with civic and religious institutions, grand estate homes and a range of modest housing types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the Carlyle houses are important for maintaining and supporting the late 19th-century character of Jarvis Street as well as contributing to the diversity of periods which the street presents as a record of its evolution.&nbsp; Located in the Garden District on the west side of the street on the block between Gerrard and Carlton streets, the two pairs of semi-detached houses maintain the setback and landscaped setting typical of 19th-century residential properties.&nbsp; Across the street, on the east side, are 19th-century buildings and a public space including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church (1875), the former Samuel Platt House (1849-50), Allan Gardens (1860) and St. Andrews Church (1878).&nbsp; To the north of the Carlyle houses, at 300 Jarvis Street, is the 1930 Art Deco Frontenac Arms hotel (now the Ramada Inn).&nbsp; To the south, at the intersection of Jarvis and Gerrard, is the Spanish-Revival Crown Hotel (now the Econo Lodge) at 335 Jarvis Street, and the Mid-century Modern, Juvenile and Family Courts Building at 311 Jarvis Street.&nbsp; These buildings and public spaces are just a small selection of the significantly rich collection of Toronto architecture and public amenities representing diverse periods, typologies and styles that characterise Jarvis Street.&nbsp; Constructed in 1890, the two pairs of semi-detached houses are physically, visually and historically linked to their surroundings, contributing to the architectural diversity of this historically important Toronto thoroughfare.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Carlyle houses at 288-290 Jarvis Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its property on the west side of Jarvis, north of Gerrard Street East in the Garden District</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting of the house with the landscaped space in front of the house</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-and-a-half storey house with its rectangular plan with a canted, north-east corner rising as a turret, the east-facing sloped roof with an octagonal pyramid roof and two dormers, recessed entrance under a broad arch with its canted walls and rear, two-storey flat-roofed wing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cladding material which includes rusticated sandstone of two types, red brick and terracotta shingles in scalloped and diamond shapes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows openings including the ground floor openings of various rectangular sizes, the second floor bay window with its wood mouldings and panels, the pair of windows in the turret, single window on the canted corner and pair of smaller windows on the centre of the elevation, on the attic storey, the single window with three lights in the large dormer, the single opening in the small dormer and the pair of windows and single window in the turret</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window glazing which may include stained glass under the wood panels at the first floor and in the turret, the double hung sash window with multiple lights in the upper sash</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary entrance with its broad arch of sandstone, canted walls with small windows and pair of doors</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative terracotta elements including the sandstone belt courses and window sills, terracotta reliefs on the arch, wrapping the turret between the first and second storeys and the single terracotta finial</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decorative brick elements including the bands of alternating projecting brick headers between the top of the second storey and the eaves and third storey and in the recessed panels under the central pair of windows at the second storey</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood rafters at the eaves</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 16, 2019, which is May 16, 2019.

Hamilton Townsend when the latter firm completed high-end residential projects in Rosedale.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Alfred Baker House is through its contribution to the residential development of Mimico in the early 20th century.&nbsp; While Mimico originated as a late-18th century milling and farming community accessed by road and water, the area remained isolated until the arrival of the steam railway and the layout of a model town in the mid-1800s.&nbsp; The introduction of a radial railway at the end of the 19th century improved connections with Toronto and promoted Mimico's steady development after 1900 as a police village, village and town.&nbsp; During this era, former farmland was developed for both waterfront estates and residential subdivisions, the latter providing housing for workers in both Mimico and neighbouring New Toronto, as well as commuters to the city, including architect Alfred Baker.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 58 Wheatfield Road has cultural heritage value through its support for the character of the neighbourhood northeast of Lake Shore Avenue West and Royal York Road where the collection of residential, ecclesiastical and educational buildings forms the historic core of the Mimico.&nbsp; The Alfred Baker House is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting on Wheatfield Road where, with its vintage and appearance, it represents the initial development of the street after the turn of the 20th century.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Alfred Baker House at 58 Wheatfield Road are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the west side of the street, south of Hillside Avenue.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2&frac12;-storey L-shaped plan, with the main body extending north and south and the short wing facing east toward Wheatfield Road.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-gable roof with the extended eaves and the purlins on the wing facing the street.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the stucco cladding and the wood and stone detailing.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation where, on the wing, the main entrance is placed in a moulded surround, protected by a wood canopy with pilasters and brackets, and flanked on the right (north) by a segmental-arched window opening.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation of the main body, the single-storey four-part square bay window in the first (ground) floor.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining fenestration, with the symmetrically-placed segmental-arched and flat-headed window openings on the east, north and south elevations of the main body and wing.</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the east elevation, the multi-paned windows in the openings in the second storey of the wing.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention Rosemary MacKenzie, Administrator, Etobicoke York Community Council, Etobicoke Civic Centre, Main floor, 399 The West Mall, Toronto, Ontario, M9C 2Y2, by 4.30 p.m. on or before May 8, 2019.</p>",

The property was listed on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in July 1976.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value as a fine representative example of Queen Anne Revival styling applied to a large house form building in the first decade of the twentieth century. The style, identified by the variety of materials and decorative detailing, asymmetrical profile and complicated roof lines, represented the exuberant architecture of the late Victorian era. The George Gooderham Mitchell House is noteworthy for its attractive combination of forms, massing and stonework.</p>\n<p>The George Gooderham Mitchell House is valued for its associations with a member of Toronto's prominent Gooderham family, which co-founded the famed Gooderham and Worts Distillery (now the Distillery District).&nbsp; The property was developed and initially occupied by stockbroker George Gooderham Mitchell, grandson of George Gooderham.</p>\n<p>The property at 226 St. George Street is also valued for its association with the architect David Roberts, Jr., who had extensive connections to the Gooderham family.&nbsp; Roberts oversaw much of the work at the Gooderham and Worts Distillery (including the reconstruction of several buildings after the 1870 fire) and designed the landmark Gooderham Building at Wellington and Front Streets (completed in 1892 and known locally as the \"Flat-Iron Building\").&nbsp; He also prepared plans for the residences of various Gooderham family members, with the grand George Gooderham House (dating to 1889-91 and currently the York Club) at the northeast corner of St. George and Bloor Streets being among his best known commissions.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 226 St. George Street has cultural heritage value for its visual and historical links to its setting in The Annex neighbourhood.&nbsp; Its appearance reflects the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century development of the area as one of the most sought-after residential enclaves in Toronto where the city's leading citizens occupied large-scale houses.&nbsp; The George Gooderham Mitchell House is significant in context with the three additional large Edwardian homes directly to the north, and other surviving house form buildings along St. George Street that were originally owned by members of the Gooderham family and/or designed by prominent Toronto architects and recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the George Gooderham Mitchell House at 226 St. George Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the west side of St. George Street south of Bernard Avenue</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the 2.5-storey plan above a raised basement</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The combination of hipped and gabled roofs including the oversized gable on the principal (east) elevation with its two symmetrically-arranged openings with double-hung sash windows, the gabled dormer windows and the brick chimneys, all on the north and south slopes</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The deep profile of the eaves at the roofline on the principal (east) and north elevations and corner tower with the wood soffits, moulded fascia and decorative brackets&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The principal (east) elevation, which is organized into three bays plus 2.5-storey corner tower at the south end, a 2-storey bay window in the north bay and the centrally-positioned main entrance</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;The main entry located on the principal (east) elevation, which is elevated and protected by a flat-roofed porch with banded stone detailing on the columns and surmounted by a brick parapet</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;At the southeast corner, the 2.5-storey octagonal corner tower with its conical roof topped with a decorative metal finial</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the south side, the single-storey, rectangular, projecting bay with its arched parapet roofline and rectangular end walls</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the east, north and south sides, the fenestration with the stone detailing that incorporates broad flat-headed openings, double-hung sash windows, and a single fixed pane window in the central opening of the first-floor bay window at the north end of the principal (east) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;On the north and south sides, the round-arched openings and their round-arched stone headers in the gabled dormers</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;The decorative glass transom above each window opening at the first-floor level on the principal (east) elevation including on the corner tower</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp;</strong> Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 2, 2019, which is May 2, 2019.

The first building constructed on the site in 1925-6 by the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. was the Main Building (including Buildings A+B), located at the northwest corner of the property and built to the design of Wells &amp; Gray Ltd., Engineers and Contractors.&nbsp; Building A included upper level offices and a shipping warehouse below and Building B contained the factory.&nbsp; From 1929 until 1980 the complex would undergo a continuous series of expansions, alterations and demolitions, primarily to the designs of Wells &amp; Gray, in response to an evolving sequence of functions related to the production of metal alloys, until operations ceased.&nbsp; One of these structures was the building known as Building G (1943) connecting the Main Building and Foundry Building (D, 1929). The proximity to the CNR railway to the south of the property meant that railway spurs were included in the property's evolution.&nbsp; In 1930 Hoyt amalgamated with other metal companies and became known as The Canada Metal Co. Ltd which continued to own the property until 2004.&nbsp; After that time the large industrial spaces accommodated Cinespace Film Studios until General Motors of Canada purchased the property in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Canada Metal Company Ltd. property, including the original Hoyt Metal Company of Canada Ltd. Main Building, the office and warehouse building (Building A), located at the property at 721 Eastern Avenue, is a fine representative of the industrial building type which emerged in the 19th century and whose key characteristic was a plan based on a structural grid of columns providing maximum internal flexibility for the accommodation of factory machinery and the production and movement of products.&nbsp; The structural grid is reflected on the building's principal (north) and side (west) elevations with their regular composition of brick piers flanking banks of windows.&nbsp; The embellishment of the building's elevations, the sculptural relief of the brick wall surface between piers and stepped brick bands over the second-floor windows, the classical styling of the entrance with its brick piers, precast stone bases and entablature incised with the word \"OFFICE,\" and the decorative panels above the entrance marked by precast stone squares, are typical of the early 20th century industrial buildings which frequently retained elements of the Classical style.</p>\n<p>Building G, the connecting link between the Main Building (A + B) and the Foundry Building (D), is valued for its design which, in the light-weight appearance of its structural steel framing and the clerestory roof, constructed to maximize daylight for factory workers, is expressive of a functionally elegant 20th-century industrial building typology.</p>\n<p>The property is valued for its association with the international Hoyt Metal Company, an important manufacturer and innovator of metal alloys in the early 20th century, which was based in the United Kingdom with branches in Australia, the U.S. A. and Canada. The Toronto branch was established in 1909 and managed by George F. Allen, an American inventor and patent-holder for inventions related to metal alloys.&nbsp; The property is also associated with the Canada Metal Company Ltd.&nbsp; In 1929, the Hoyt Metal Company of Canada merged with the Toronto-based Canada Metal Company Ltd. a nation-wide employer and manufacturer of metal alloy products, which started in the 1890s by William G. Harris in the backyard of his home on St. Patrick Street. The Canada Metal Co. continued to operate at the Eastern Avenue property from 1929 until 2004 and was an important employer in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The property has historic value for the information it yields regarding the growth of industry and how it contributed to the development of the working class neighbourhood between World Wars I and II.&nbsp; The building is also valued as it demonstrates the work of the firm of Wells &amp; Gray Ltd.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 363-365, 367, 381 and 385-389 Yonge Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">363-365 Yonge Street</span> - Richard S. Williams Block</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 363-365 Yonge Street (Richard S. Williams Block) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould and Gerrard Streets, the Richard S. Williams Block (1890) is a four-storey commercial building. The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1974.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Richard S. Williams Block has design value as a fine representative and rare example in Toronto of a late-nineteenth century Victorian commercial building eclectically designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style with Moorish Revival details. The composition and detailing of the principal (west) elevation on Yonge Street, with its rusticated stone and red brick cladding combined with horseshoe arches, key and diaper patterns and decorative terracotta, display a high degree of artistic merit. In recognition of its architectural significance, the building was amongst some of the earliest included on the City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in March 1974.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Richard S. Williams Block has historic value for its association with the architects, A. R. Denison and G. W. King. Concurrent with construction of the Richard S. Williams Block, the design partnership of Denison &amp; King produced two other known similarly eclectic Victorian buildings in the city that, together, represent a rare collection blending eastern design influences with contemporary western revival architectural styles. These include the Comstock Building at Victoria and Lombard Streets and the Athenaeum Club on Church Street, both of which are designated properties under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East, the Richard S. Williams Block has contextual value as it supports and maintains the late-nineteenth century commercial building character that defines much of the historic built form of downtown Yonge Street as it developed as Toronto's 'main street'.&nbsp; As one of a number of heritage properties on both sides of this block of Yonge Street, the Richard S. Williams Block is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Richard S. Williams Block are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey commercial building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its red brick, stone and terracotta cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressed metal cornice with its dentilled detailing at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of openings and detailing on the principal (west) elevation, divided vertically into three identical bays</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pattern and decorative detailing of the wood window mullions in the fixed glass panes on the principal (west) elevation at the second floor</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red brick details including the decorative frieze in a (diamond) diaper pattern below the roofline, the raised horizontal string courses in the spandrels above the horseshoe arches at the fourth floor, the brick voussoirs of the horseshoe-arched openings and the three identical key pattern designs repeated in the spandrel areas between the third and fourth-floor openings</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone details including the rusticated sandstone cladding of the four piers at the first floor level surmounted by their elaborately carved capitals, the four smooth capitals and rusticated lintel below the third floor, the smooth headers above the third-floor openings, the smooth sills and the imposts of the horseshoe arched openings at the fourth floor</p>\n<p>The terracotta details including the dentilled cornice with four decorative lion heads below the third floor, the three decorative tile borders framing the third and fourth-floor window openings and their respective cornices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">367 Yonge Street</span> - <strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street contains a three-storey building with retail at the ground floor and residential above. The building was constructed by 1869 of solid brick construction with brick cladding (currently covered with stucco on the west elevation).&nbsp; The property is located on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 367 Yonge Street has design value as a representative example of a mid-nineteenth century commercial and residential building that blends elements of the Georgian and Greek Revival styles. The principal (west) elevation's symmetrically-arranged, flat-headed openings with their segmental-arched headers surmounted by scroll corbels and stone sills below are further enlivened by a corbelled brick Greek key pattern frieze below the decorative wood-bracketed roofline.</p>\n<p>The building has historic value as it is associated with the earliest development of this portion of Yonge Street in the mid-nineteenth century. Along with the two attached buildings directly north of the subject property, this three-storey group represents the tallest and earliest solid brick construction on this block of Yonge Street that otherwise contained only one or two-storey wood frame buildings before 1870.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street, between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East and directly adjacent to the Richard S. Williams Block at 363-365 Yonge Street, the property at 367 Yonge Street has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise commercial and residential building character that defined the historic built form of the area in the second half of the nineteenth century. It is physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the property at 367 Yonge Street are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street between Gould Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and residential building built on a rectangular plan with a pitched roof and brick chimney with its corbelled brick crown at the north end</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its buff brick, stone and wood cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood fascia and soffit at the roofline and decorative corbelled brick frieze directly below</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The symmetrical arrangement of flat-headed openings on the second and third floors of the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone detailing including the window sills and segmental-arched headers above the second and third floor openings with their scroll-shaped corbel brackets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the pattern of divisions of windows with a transom light in the first floor window, and for the second and third floor windows, as shown in the original architect's drawings, the double-hung sash featuring two lights over one</p>\n<p>Note: the stucco currently covering the brick cladding on the principal (west) elevation is not considered a heritage attribute</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">381 Yonge Street</span> - Yonge Street Mission Building</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street (Yonge Street Mission Building) is worthy of inclusion on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register and designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street contains the Yonge Street Mission, an institutional building located on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East. Originally constructed in 1904, the Yonge Street Mission is a two-storey structure with a pitched roof including five skylights along the ridgeline. The principal (west) elevation was completely rebuilt to the designs of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, architects, in 1953.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Yonge Street Mission Building has design value as a fine representative of a low-rise, mid-twentieth century institutional building whose Stripped Classicism is indicative of the work of the prominent Toronto architectural firm, Mathers &amp; Haldenby. The style defines a transitional moment in Toronto architecture immediately following WWII that was expressed as a blending of Neo-Classicism and Modernism. At the Yonge Street Mission Building, traditional limestone cladding and details maintain a classical monumentality on the principal (west) elevation while the strong verticality of the openings and their minimalist detailing harken toward Modernist curtain wall construction and its associated aesthetic.</p>\n<p>The property at 381 Yonge Street has historic value for its association with the history of the Yonge Street Mission founded in 1896 and the organization's operation at the subject location since 1904 (then owned by the Hon. Samuel Hume Blake), providing charitable services and social programs to vulnerable residents in Toronto. Since 1979, the Mission's Evergreen Centre has focused these efforts on the needs of street youth.</p>\n<p>The current building is valued for its association with the architectural firm of Mathers &amp; Haldenby, who designed many prominent mid-century structures across the city including the iconic Imperial Oil Building at 111 St. Clair Avenue West, which is recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>Situated on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East and abutting the corner property at 385-391 Yonge Street, the Yonge Street Mission has contextual value as it maintains the low-rise building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century.</p>\n<p>The Yonge Street Mission is also valued as a long-time local landmark institution on Yonge Street, south of Gerrard. This charitable organization has provided assistance to Toronto's most vulnerable residents since its founding in 1896 and has operated continuously from 381 Yonge Street since 1904. The Yonge Street Mission is an important institution in the social history of the city that has been physically, functionally, visually and historically linked to its surroundings for the past 115 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Yonge Street Mission Building are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the east side of Yonge Street south of Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the two-storey building with its flat roof behind a gabled parapet on the principal (west) elevation and pitched roof with five skylights over the auditorium (which are part of the Yonge Street Mission building's earlier 1904 design by the architectural firm, G. M. Miller &amp; Co. and appear in the original architectural drawings).</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (west) elevation with its Indiana limestone cladding</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bracketed wood soffit at the roofline on the principal (west) elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration on the upper floor of the principal (west) elevation with the three evenly-spaced rectangular openings with stone headers, surrounds and profiled mullions in a three-over-three-over-three pattern centrally and two-over-two-over-two near the north and south ends</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The carvings in their centred position in the limestone entablature on the principal (west) elevation including the lighthouse emblem, architectural lettering reading \"Yonge Street Mission\" and two equal-sided crosses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">385-391 Yonge Street (including 3 Gerrard Street East)</span> - Gerrard Building</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East, the Gerrard Building (1924) is a three-storey commercial and office building.&nbsp; The property was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 1990.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building has design value as a fine representative, and rare example along Yonge Street, of the Modern Gothic style adapted to a commercial building. It is distinguished by its contemporary updating of a historical style with its sleek sandstone cladding and tripartite division of window openings in a variation of the Chicago Style along with stylized octagonal piers and wall buttresses.</p>\n<p>The Gerrard Building has historic value for its association with the prolific architects, Sproatt &amp; Rolph, and is recognized amongst the numerous fine commercial buildings the firm designed in Toronto during the early-twentieth century including the Royal York Hotel on Front Street. The site is also associated with The Forum, a grand High Victorian commercial block that formerly anchored this corner and contributes to an understanding of the evolution of the intersection at Yonge and Gerrard Streets.</p>\n<p>Situated prominently on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East the Gerrard Building has contextual value as it anchors and maintains the low-rise commercial building character that defined the historic built form of the area from the mid-nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. With its position on a corner lot and grand presence, the Gerrard Building stands as a reminder of the grandeur of Yonge Street as it developed in the early twentieth century.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Gerrard Building are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Gerrard Street East</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey commercial and office building built on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, the sandstone cladding with stone trim</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Yonge Street (west) elevation, the location and stone detailing of the entry at the south end of the building</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the flat-headed openings and their detailing on the Yonge Street (west) and Gerrard Street East (north) elevations, which are divided vertically into four bays and six bays, respectively</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrangement of the fenestration in the upper floors on the west and north elevations including its tripartite division by secondary piers, and with the central opening containing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above each window pane on the second and third floors of the west and north elevations, the transom lights (currently opaque spandrels) with their four-over-four arrangement (as seen in the original architectural drawings and 1950 archival photographs)</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the west and north elevations, the stone detailing including the octagonal piers with their faux compound piers and pointed finials at the first floor, and the decorative carved stone band surmounted by a continuous stone cornice directly above the third floor openings.3.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designations may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of April 2, 2019, which is May 2, 2019.

    "noticeDate": 1553054400000,
    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 49 Spadina Avenue under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Steele Briggs Building:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation, under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue is located on the northeast corner of Front Street West south of Clarence Square in the King-Spadina neighbourhood and contains a five-storey factory building that was constructed in 1911 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Seed Company commissioned the building, which it occupied it for over half a century.</p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue was included on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Register) in June 1973.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 49 Spadina Avenue as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 49 Spadina Avenue has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory building in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design of the Steele Briggs Building is particularly distinguished by the application of different yet complementary classical detailing on the south, west and north elevations that face Front Street West, Spadina Avenue and Clarence Square, respectively, including the repetition of the round arch motif.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 49 Spadina Avenue is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building replaced earlier house form buildings that outlined the south edge of Clarence Square and anchored the south end of the collection of industrial buildings extending north along Spadina Avenue from Front Street West.</p>\n<p>The Steele Briggs Building is also valued for its historical association with the Toronto architects Sproatt and Rolph.&nbsp; Headed by Henry Sproatt and Ernest Rolph, the partnership became amongst the leading architectural firms in Canada and is credited with introducing the influential Neo-Gothic as a national style with the commission for Hart House at the University of Toronto.&nbsp; Often working in association with other celebrated Canadian architects, Sproatt and Rolph produced many of Toronto&rsquo;s most notable buildings, including the Royal York Hotel (1929) and Canada Life's 1931 headquarters on University Avenue.&nbsp; Sproatt and Rolph designed several factories and warehouses in King-Spadina, with the Steele Briggs Building remaining the most visually prominent with its setting overlooking Clarence Square.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 49 Spadina Avenue is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Steele Briggs Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at Front Street West and Spadina Avenue where it anchors this major intersection, overlooks the adjoining Clarence Square and forms the south edge of the industrial buildings that line Spadina Avenue and include the Gale Building (1904) at 24 Spadina and the Systems Building (1907) at 46 Spadina, which are recognized heritage properties on the opposite side of the street.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Steele Briggs Building at 49 Spadina Avenue are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northeast corner of Front Street West and Spadina Avenue, south of Clarence Square</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey building above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The flat roofline with the brick parapets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The south, west and north elevations where the brick piers with the stone detailing organize the flat-headed door and window openings with the stone lintels and sills and the round-arched door openings with the brick voussoirs and stone keystones, including those originally designed for cargo doors</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; On the south elevation facing Front Street West, the round-arched door and window openings in each storey of the central bay</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; The west elevation on Spadina Avenue where four-storey frontispieces surmounted by cornices contain round-arched arcades of windows</p>\n<p>There are no openings on the rear (east) elevation.&nbsp; The low-rise east wing, which has been altered, is not identified as a heritage attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation</strong> may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 20, 2019, which is April 19, 2019. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>",

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 15 Duncan Street and 158 Pearl Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>15 DUNCAN STREET&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street is worthy of&nbsp; designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act or its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street is located on the northeast corner of Pearl Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Company commissioned the building, which it occupied for over half a century.</p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 15 Duncan Street as a contributing heritage property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Duncan Street has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp; The design is distinguished by its symmetry and the classical embellishments that are identified with the style, and particularly by the arcades of round arches on the principal (west) and the south elevations on Duncan and Pearl streets, respectively.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 15 Duncan is also through its half-century association with the Canada Printing Ink Company, which was internationally recognized for its development of inks for newspapers, magazines and other print media.&nbsp; In its manufacturing complex in King-Spadina, the company produced specialty inks and developed new technologies, which included the Maxichrom System (the forerunner to the Mix-and-Match System of the 1970s) where any colour could be matched using 12 basic inks.</p>\n<p>The Canada Printing Ink Building is valued for its contributions to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building was one of the first buildings completed on the former Upper Canada College lands following the redevelopment of the campus for industrial uses.</p>\n<p>The historical value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is also through its connection with the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg, which designed the Canada Printing Ink Building prior to the dissolution of the partnership.&nbsp; While W. R. (William Rufus) Gregg and his younger brother, A. R. (Alfred Holden) Gregg led successful architectural practices alone and with other architects, during the period from 1893 to 1904 when they worked together the pair is credited with several factories in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, including the Eclipse Whitewear Building (1903) at King Street West and John Street, the White Swan Mills Building at 158 Pearl Street, and the subject building.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 15 Duncan Street is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it is part of an important collection of former factories and warehouses that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential district to Toronto's manufacturing centre after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Printing Ink Building is historically and visually linked to its setting where, with the adjoining White Swan Mills Building (1903) at 158 Pearl Street and the Southam Press Building (1908) at 19 Duncan Street, it is part of the surviving trio of early 20th century industrial buildings that anchor the northeast corner of Duncan and Pearl streets, south of Adelaide Street West.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Canada Printing Ink Building at 15 Duncan Street are:</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the northeast corner of Duncan and Pearl streets</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the three-storey building above the raised base with the window openings</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The roofline, with the extended eaves</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The organization of the principal (west) elevation on Duncan Street into 10 bays and the south elevation along Pearl Street into seven bays</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classical arrangement of the principal (west) and south elevations, with the base, the two-storey arcades and, above the stone cornice, the attic</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration, with the segmental-arched openings in the base, first and third stories (as well as the pair of diminutive openings above the west entrance), the round-arched openings in the second storey, and the brick and stone trim</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The west entrance, which is placed in the fifth bay from the south end and has been altered</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (west) elevation, the two northernmost bays that have been altered to reflect the design of the original building.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>158 PEARL STREET</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street (which includes the address at 154 Pearl Street) is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street is located on the north side of the street, east of Duncan Street, and contains a three-storey factory building that was constructed in 1903 according to the designs of the Toronto architectural firm of Gregg and Gregg.&nbsp; The original occupant, White Swan Mills, producers of flour, cereals and spices, remained in this location for 25 years, followed by the stationery department of the Canadian Bank of Commerce (forerunner to today's Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, or CIBC) for over 30 years.</p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street was included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; In October 2017, Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2018, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 158 Pearl Street as a contributing heritage property.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 158 Pearl Street has design value as a well-crafted example of an early 20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, which was designed with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era. &nbsp;The design of the White Swan Mills Building is distinguished by its symmetry and the classical embellishments that are identified with the style, and particularly by the semi-arched pediments that mark either end of the principal (south) elevation.</p>\n<p>The White Swan Mills Building is also valued for its contributions to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional enclave adjoined by residential subdivisions to Toronto's new manufacturing district after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp;

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and buildings known municipally as 64 Wellesley Street East under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east), the property at 64 Wellesley Street East contains the Wellesley Apartments, a five-storey apartment building completed in 1931 according to the designs of Toronto architect J. E. H. Paisley.&nbsp; The site was identified as having cultural heritage interest in the North Downtown Yonge Street Urban Design Guidelines adopted by City Council in 2013.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Significance:</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 64 Wellesley Street East is valued for its design as a well-crafted apartment building from the interwar era with features of the Georgian Revival style popularized for residential architecture.&nbsp; Its design is distinguished by the classical detailing on the main (south) entrance surround, which is a hallmark of the style, as well as the stair-hall window above with its scrollwork and metal balustrade, and the parapet along the south roofline with the stone-framed openings and triangular-shaped pediment.</p>\n<p>The associative value of the Wellesley Apartments is through the connection of the building to Toronto architect J. E. H. (James Edward Harris) Paisley who designed the complex.&nbsp; Paisley was affiliated with the Toronto Board of Education and local practitioner Ferdinand H. Marani before he established a solo office in the 1920s.&nbsp; While his career was hindered by the Great Depression of the 1930s, he received recognition through his designs for a small collection of apartment houses for Grover C. Murdoch, including 64 Wellesley Street East, as part of his surviving portfolio in Toronto.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 64 Wellesley Street East has cultural heritage value through its historical, visual and physical links to its setting beside the Paul Kane House (1853, with later additions), a local landmark in Toronto, and its proximity to Church Street in the centre of the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Wellesley Apartments at 64 Wellesley Street East are:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of the street between Yonge Street (west) and Church Street (east) and beside (east of) the Paul Kane House</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the five-storey I-shaped plan, which is organized with the main body (south) and the wing (north)</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the brick cladding and the brick, stone, wood and metal detailing</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the parapet at the south end, which has stone-framed openings, stone coping and a triangular-shaped stone pediment in the centre</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the principal (south) elevation, the organization of the wall into five bays with the central entrance in the first (ground) floor</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main (south) entrance, which is placed in a stone surround with classical detailing that includes an entablature, mouldings and brackets</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the south elevation, above the main entrance, the stair-hall window in the scalloped stone surround with the metal balustrade</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fenestration on the south elevation, with the flat-headed single window openings in the centre and outer bays, the tripartite window openings in the remaining bays, and the stone sills, brick flat arches and stone keystones</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stone band courses on the base and above the first- and fifth-floor openings on the south elevation, which extend across the south ends of the east and west side walls of the main body</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The east and west elevations of the main body of the building, which continue the pattern and detailing of the flat-headed openings from the south elevation</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The north wing of the building, which is set back from the main body on the east and west sides and extended at the north end to complete the &ldquo;I&rdquo; shape</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the north wing, the brick band courses and the symmetrically-placed flat-headed door and window openings with the brick and stone detailing.</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of&nbsp; March 18, 2019, which is April 17, 2019.

    "noticeDescription": "<p>Take notice that Toronto City Council intends to designate the lands and building known municipally as 663 King Street West under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p><strong>Canada Biscuit Company Building</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under all three categories of design, associative and contextual value.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street in the King-Spadina neighbourhood, the property at 663 King Street West contains a four-storey industrial building that was constructed in 1900 for the Canada Biscuit Company according to the designs of Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; Following the demise of the latter company in 1905, the complex was acquired by a trio of manufacturers&rsquo; agents who headed the Anglo-Canadian Leather Company, which became the lead tenant in the building.&nbsp; A significant occupant between 1907 and 1921 was the Reliance Knitting Company, which eventually purchased the property following its amalgamation with another manufacturer.&nbsp; The Samuel Trees Company, a saddlery manufacturer that evolved its business to produce automobile fittings, owned and occupied the building for nearly 40 years, a period when the Bank of Montreal operated a branch on the premises.</p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West was listed on the inaugural City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties (now known as the Heritage Inventory) in 1973.&nbsp; The King-Spadina HCD Plan (2016) identifies 663 King Street West as a contributing heritage property.&nbsp; Council designated the King-Spadina Heritage Conservation District (HCD) under Part V of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1111-2017, which was amended by By-law 1241-2017.&nbsp; In 2019, the HCD was under appeal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value:</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 663 King Street West has design value as a well-crafted example of an early-20th century factory in the King-Spadina neighbourhood with features of Edwardian Classicism, the most popular style for most building types during this era.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sheer scale of the building is viewed on Bathurst Street where the west elevation extends 14 bays to Stewart Street, and the principal (north) elevation on King Street is distinguished by the stone facing of the lower wall and the organization of the windows above in a three-storey arcade.</p>\n<p>The cultural heritage value of 663 King Street West is also through its contribution to the development and evolution of the King-Spadina neighbourhood in the early 20th century when the area changed from an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s new manufacturing district following the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building anchors a major intersection in King-Spadina where it is an integral part of the collection of industrial buildings that extends along King Street West.</p>\n<p>The Canada Biscuit Company Building is also valued for its historical association with Toronto architect A. R. (Arthur Richard) Denison.&nbsp; A member of one of the city&rsquo;s founding families, Denison accepted innumerable commissions during a career that lasted more than 40 years and included brief partnerships with other practitioners.&nbsp; During the period in the early 1900s when he designed the Canada Biscuit Company Building, Denison specialized in factories and warehouses, including the E. W. Gillett Company&rsquo;s complex (1912) on Fraser Street in today&rsquo;s Liberty Village, which is also recognized on the City&rsquo;s Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>Contextually, the value of the property at 663 King Street West is through its support for the historical character of the King-Spadina neighbourhood where it contributes to the important collection of former warehouses and factories that changed the area from its origins as an institutional and residential enclave to Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing sector after the Great Fire of 1904.&nbsp; The Canada Biscuit Company Building is historically, visually and physically linked to its setting at King Street West and Bathurst Street where it anchors a major intersection in both King-Spadina and Toronto with the landmark Wheat Sheaf Tavern (1849) on the opposite (southwest) corner.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>The heritage attributes of the Canada Biscuit Company Building at 663 King Street West are:</p>\n<p>&middot;The placement, setback and orientation of the building on the southeast corner of Bathurst Street</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale, form and massing of the four-storey building with the rectangular-shaped plan above the raised base with the flat-headed window openings</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials, with the red brick cladding and the brick, stone and wood detailing</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flat roofline with the corbelled brickwork along the north, west and south elevations</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal (north) elevation on King Street West with the stone cladding in the first storey where the main entrance is centered between two oversized flat-headed window openings and, in the upper three stories, brick arcades organize the pairs of flat-headed window openings with the continuous stone lintels and sills</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extended west elevation on Bathurst Street, with the organization and detailing of the flat-headed door and window openings, some of which have been altered</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the west elevation, the cornice between the third and fourth stories in the southerly seven bays, which marks the point where the complementary extra storey was added</p>\n<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rear (south) elevation on Stewart Street extending five bays, which has an entrance in the first (ground) floor and pairs of flat-headed window openings above, and where the cornice between the third and fourth stories is continued from the west elevation</p>\n<p>No heritage attributes are identified on the east elevation.&nbsp; The adjoining four-storey building at 60 Stewart Street is not identified in the Statement of Significance (Reasons for Designation).</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the proposed designation may be served on the City Clerk, Attention:&nbsp; Ellen Devlin, Administrator, Toronto and East York Community Council, Toronto City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, 2nd floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2, within thirty days of March 13, 2019, which is April 12, 2019. The notice of objection must set out the reason(s) for the objection, and all relevant facts.</p>",
